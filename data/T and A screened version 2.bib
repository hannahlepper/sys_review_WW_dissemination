abstract = {World Health Organizations launched a global action plan on antimicrobial resistance since 2015. Along with other objectives, the plan was aimed to strengthen knowledge of the spread of antimicrobial resistance through surveillance and research. Given their high bacterial densities and that they receive antibiotics, metals, and other selective agents, wastewater systems are a logical hotspot for antibiotic resistance surveillance. The current study reports on the result of antibiotic resistance surveillance conducted in selected wastewater systems of Eastern Ethiopia from Feb. 2018 to Oct. 2019. We monitored three wastewater systems in Eastern Ethiopia, such as the activated sludge system of Dire Dawa University, waste stabilization pond of Haramaya University, and a septic tank of Hiwot Fana Specialized University Hospital for 18 months period. We collected 66 wastewater samples from 11 sampling locations and isolated 722 bacteria using selective culture media and biochemical tests. We tested their antibiotic susceptibility using the standard Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method on the surface of the Mueller-Hinton agar and interpreted the result according to EUCAST guidelines. The result shows the highest percentage of resistance for ampicillin among isolates of hospital wastewater effluent which is 36 (94.7%), 33 (91.7%), and 32 (88.9%) for E. coli, E. faecalis, and E. faecium, respectively. A lower rate of resistance was seen for gentamicin among isolates of activated sludge wastewater treatment system which is 10 (16.4%), 8 (13.3%), 11 (18.9%), and 12 (20.3%) for E. coli, E. faecalis, E. faecium, and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Hospital wastewater exhibited higher resistance than the other two wastewater systems. The Multiple Antibiotic Resistance Index (MARI) has significantly increased in the wastewater's course treatment process, showing the proliferation of resistance in the wastewater treatment system.},

abstract = {The presence of pan-resistant bacteria worldwide possesses a threat to global health. It is difficult to evaluate the extent of carriage of resistant bacteria in the population. Sewage sampling is a possible way to monitor populations. We evaluated the presence of pan-resistant bacteria in Israeli sewage collected from all over Israel, by modifying the pour plate method for heterotrophic plate count technique using commercial selective agar plates. This method enables convenient and fast sewage sampling and detection. We found that sewage in Israel contains multiple pan-resistant bacteria including carbapenemase resistant Enterobacteriacae carrying blaKPC and blaNDM-1, MRSA and VRE. blaKPC carrying Klebsiella pneumonia and Enterobacter cloacae were the most common Enterobacteriacae drug resistant bacteria found in the sewage locations we sampled. Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Citrobacter spp. were the 4 main CRE isolated from Israeli sewage and also from clinical samples in our clinical microbiology laboratory. Hospitals and Community sewage had similar percentage of positive samplings for blaKPC and blaNDM-1. VRE was found to be more abundant in sewage in Israel than MRSA but there were more locations positive for MRSA and VRE bacteria in Hospital sewage than in the Community. Therefore, our upgrade of the pour plate method for heterotrophic plate count technique using commercial selective agar plates can be a useful tool for routine screening and monitoring of the population for pan-resistant bacteria using sewage.},

abstract = {Background: Human exposure to antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) is a public health concern which could occur in a number of ways. Wastewaters seem to play an important role in the dissemination of bacteria and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) in our environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of three groups of ARB and their resistance genes in hospital and municipal wastewaters (MWs) as possible sources. Methods: A total of 66 samples were collected from raw MWs and hospital wastewaters (HWs) and final effluents of related wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Samples were analyzed for the detection of three groups of ARB including gentamicin (GM), chloramphenicol (CHL) and ceftazidime resistant bacteria and their ARGs (aac (3)-1, cmlA1 and ctx-m-32, respectively). Results: The mean concentration of GM, CHL and ceftazidime resistant bacteria in raw wastewater samples was 1.24 × 107, 3.29 × 107and 5.54 × 107 colony forming unit/100 ml, respectively. There is a variation in prevalence of different groups of ARB in MWs and HWs. All WWTPs decreased the concentration of ARB. However, high concentration of ARB was found in the final effluent of WWTPs. Similar to ARB, different groups of ARGs were found frequently in both MWs and HWs. All genes also detected with a relative high frequency in effluent samples of MWs WWTPs. Conclusions: Discharge of final effluent from conventional WWTPs is a potential route for dissemination of ARB and ARGs into the natural environment and poses a hazard to environmental and public health.},

There was little difference in the counts of organisms with nontransferable resistance to one or more of 13 commonly used drugs. An average of 26% of coliforms in hospital waste water had transferable resistance to at least one of the drugs ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamide, or tetracycline as compared to an average of 4% in city sewage. R(+) bacteria in the hospital discharge were also resistant to a broader spectrum of drugs than those in city sewage. In both effluents, the occurrence of fecal Escherichia coli among R(+) coliforms was twice as high as among coliforms with nontransferable resistance. Resistance was transferable to Salmonella typhi, and such drug-resistant pathogens in the water environment could be of particular concern. The significance of the results with regard to environmental pollution with R(+) bacteria and the dissemination of these organisms is discussed.},

E. coli was the predominant bacterial contaminant at site 1 which is near sewage of several hospitals in Baghdad Medical City. The influence of different water quality parameters (total dissolved solids, electric conductivity, alkalinity, turbidity, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, phosphate ion, nitrate, sulphate, chloride) and heavy metals (Cd, Zn, Co, Cu, and Ni) were investigated at bacterial contaminated site 1. Besides, physiological parameters (pH value and temperature) were applied.

Resistance is mediated by acetyltransferases SatA (VatD) or SatG (VatE). Recent papers have indicated a possible link between the use of the streptogramin virginiamycin S/M as a feed additive in commercial animal husbandry and a selection of quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant E. faecium (QDRE). We screened manure samples from two different turkey farms and from six different pig farms (using virginiamycin), samples from a sewage water treatment plant, 24 broiler carcasses, 10 pork samples, and 200 stool samples of nonhospitalized humans for QDRE. Our strain culture collection of hospital E. faecium isolates from the last 2 years was also reviewed for QDRE. All manure and sewage samples were positive for QDRE, as well as 11 from broiler carcasses (46%), 1 from pork (10%), and 28 from human stool specimens (14%). Thirty-six hospital isolates of E. faecium exhibited resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin. In 141 QDRE of different origin satA (vatD) and satG (vatE) genes were detected (seven isolates from humans with an unknown resistance mechanism). Streptogramin resistance determinants were tansferable in filtermating experiments for 5 of 10 satA (vatD) and 9 of 22 satG (vatE) isolates. Different EcoRI patterns of satG (vatE) plasmids and corresponding hybridizations of the satG (vatE) gene indicated nonhomologous resistance plasmids in isolates of different origin. The results of this study indicate a common gene pool for streptogramin resistance in E. faecium of different ecological origin. A selection of QDRE using the streptogramin virginiamycin S/M as a feed additive and a spread of the resistance via the food chain to humans is probable.},

Class 1 integrons with the frequent presence of aadA and aac(6 ')-Ib gene cassettes in 50% of NDM-bearing isolates are indicative of possible selective pressures generated out of unregulated use of streptomycin, in agriculture practiced by the cultivators and tea planters living in locales drained by these two rivers, in their up- and downstream, and amikacin in the most crowded government-sponsored "sadar" and district hospitals of Siliguri and Jalpaiguri.

Within the last decade however, ESBL-producing bacteria have started spreading into the community and the environment. In this study, ESBL-producing Escherichia coli from sewage sludge were collected, analysed and compared to ESBL-E. coli from human urinary tract infections (UTIs). The dominant ESBL-gene-family in both sample groups was bla(CTX-M), which is the most prevalent ESBL-gene-family in human infection. Still, the distribution of ESBL genes and the frequency of additional antibiotic resistances differed in the two sample sets. Nevertheless, phenotyping did not divide isolates of the two sources into separate groups, suggesting similar strains in both sample sets. We speculate that an exchange is taking place between the ESBL E. coli populations in infected humans and sewage sludge, most likely by the entry of ESBL E. coli from UTIs into the sewage system.},

Sweden ceased using avoparcin in 1986, and only occasional cases of VRE from hospitals have been reported since 1995. Within the framework of a European study, samples from urban raw sewage, treated sewage, surface water, and hospital sewage in Sweden (n = 118) were screened for VRE. Surprisingly, VRE were isolated from 21 of 35 untreated sewage samples (60%), from 5 of 14 hospital sewage samples (36%), from 6 of 32 treated sewage samples (19%), and from 1 of 37 surface water samples. Thirty-five isolates from 33 samples were further characterized by geno- and phenotyping, MIC determination, and PCR analysis. Most isolates (30 of 35) carried the vanA gene, and the majority (24 of 35) of the isolates were Enterococcus faecium. Most of the VRE were multiresistant. The typing revealed high diversity of the isolates. However, one major cluster with seven identical or similar isolates was found. These isolates came from three different sewage treatment plants and were collected at different occasions during 1 year. All VRE from hospital sewage originated from one of the two hospitals studied. That hospital also had vancomycin consumption that was 10-fold that of the other. We conclude that VRE were commonly found in sewage samples in Sweden. The origin might be both healthy individuals and individuals in hospitals. Possibly, antimicrobial drugs or chemicals released into the sewage system may sustain VRE in the system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microbial communities present in environmental waters constitute a  reservoir for antibiotic-resistant pathogens that impact human health. For this reason, a diverse variety of water environments are being analyzed using metagenomics to uncover public health threats. However, the composition of these communities along the coastal environment of a whole city, where sewage and beach waters are mixed, is poorly understood. RESULTS: We shotgun-sequenced 20 coastal areas from the city of Montevideo (capital of Uruguay) including beach and sewage water samples to characterize bacterial communities and their virulence and antibiotic resistance repertories. As expected, we found that sewage and beach environments present significantly different bacterial communities. This baseline allowed us to detect a higher prevalence and a more diverse repertory of virulence and antibiotic-resistant genes in sewage samples. Many of these genes come from well-known enterobacteria and represent carbapenemases and extended-spectrum betalactamases reported in hospital infections in Montevideo. Additionally, we were able to genotype the presence of both globally disseminated pathogenic clones and emerging antibiotic-resistant bacteria in sewage waters. CONCLUSIONS: Our study represents the first in using metagenomics to jointly analyze beaches and the sewage system from an entire city, allowing us to characterize antibiotic-resistant pathogens circulating in urban waters. The data generated in this initial study represent a baseline metagenomic exploration to guide future longitudinal (time-wise) studies, whose systematic implementation will provide useful epidemiological information to improve public health surveillance.},

abstract = {The number of environmental antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) has increased dramatically since the start of antibiotic mass production for broad bacterial infection treatment in 1944. Nowadays, ARB and their resistance-determining genes (ARGs) are readily detected in all environments, including the human food chain. A highly relevant food group in this context is fresh produce, frequent raw consumption of which facilitates direct transfer of ARB and ARGs to the consumer. Here, we investigate the persistence of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) pEK499 and its clinically most important ARG (bla(CTX-M-15)), after introduction via irrigation water or manure into a lettuce-growing system. Culturable ESBL-producing E. coli persisted longest in soil and when introduced via manure (until 9 weeks after introduction), while being undetectable on lettuce beyond day 7. In contrast, qPCR detection of bla(CTX-M-15) was much more frequent: introduction via water significantly increased bla(CTX-M-15) on lettuce until week 4, as opposed to manure, which affected the soil in the long-term (9 weeks) while leading to bla(CTX-M-15) detection on lettuce until day 7 only. Our findings demonstrate long-term persistence of undesired ARB and ARG after their introduction via both irrigation and amendment. Such an understanding of the persistence kinetics of an ESBL-producing E. coli and plasmid-encoded bla(CTX-M-15) aids the determination of critical actions in order to mitigate their transfer to the consumer.},

abstract = {Group D streptococci isolated from clinical specimens and from sewage were investigated with regard to resistance to tetracycline (Tc), erythromycin (Em), and chloramphenicol (Cm). The median values of the percentages of resistant strains from sewage were: for Tc, 14%; for Em, 2.8%; and for Cm, 0.1%. For the recent isolates of clinical origin, resistance percentages found were 58% for Tc, 12% for Em, and 14% for Cm, and, in comparison to clinical isolates from 1964, the incidence of drug resistance slightly increased. In strains of both sources, the drug resistance was often found to be transferable to another group D streptococcus, probably by conjugation. Two strains were able to transfer their Em resistance to a streptococcus strain of group B. No transfer of drug resistance to a group A streptococcus and Escherichia coli was observed. All beta-hemolytic streptococci were also bacteriocinogenic, and frequently these properties were found to be transferable. The function, size, and base composition of the plasmids of two drug-resistant Streptococcus faecalis strains were investigated; strain M439 harbors at least two conjugative plasmids: pRI401, molecular weight 30 x 10(6), coding for Tc resistance, and pRI402, molecular weight 41 x 10(6), coding for Em resistance. Strain M403 carries one single conjugative plasmid species, coding for Tc resistance. The molecular weight of this plasmid, pRI404, was 37 x 10(6). The guanine plus cytosine content of these plasmids was 35 to 36%.},

An average of 26% of coliforms in hospital waste water had transferable resistance to at least one of the drugs ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamide, or tetracycline as compared to an average of 4% in city sewage. R(+) bacteria in the hospital discharge were also resistant to a broader spectrum of drugs than those in city sewage. In both effluents, the occurrence of fecal Escherichia coli among R(+) coliforms was twice as high as among coliforms with nontransferable resistance. Resistance was transferable to Salmonella typhi, and such drug-resistant pathogens in the water environment could be of particular concern. The significance of the results with regard to environmental pollution with R(+) bacteria and the dissemination of these organisms is discussed.},

abstract = {The use of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine has coincided with a rise  in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the food-borne pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. Faecal contamination from the main reservoir hosts (livestock, especially poultry) is the principal route of human infection but little is known about the spread of AMR among source and sink populations. In particular, questions remain about how Campylobacter resistomes interact between species and hosts, and the potential role of sewage as a conduit for the spread of AMR. Here, we investigate the genomic variation associated with AMR in 168 C. jejuni and 92 C. coli strains isolated from humans, livestock and urban effluents in Spain. AMR was tested in vitro and isolate genomes were sequenced and screened for putative AMR genes and alleles. Genes associated with resistance to multiple drug classes were observed in both species and were commonly present in multidrug-resistant genomic islands (GIs), often located on plasmids or mobile elements. In many cases, these loci had alleles that were shared among C. jejuni and C. coli consistent with horizontal transfer. Our results suggest that specific antibiotic resistance genes have spread among Campylobacter isolated from humans, animals and the environment.},

abstract = {The hospital environment is a potential reservoir of bacteria with plasmids conferring carbapenem resistance. Our Hospital Epidemiology Service routinely performs extensive sampling of high-touch surfaces, sinks, and other locations in the hospital. Over a 2-year period, additional sampling was conducted at a broader range of locations, including housekeeping closets, wastewater from hospital internal pipes, and external manholes. We compared these data with previously collected information from 5 years of patient clinical and surveillance isolates. Whole-genome sequencing and analysis of 108 isolates provided comprehensive characterization of blaKPC/blaNDM-positive isolates, enabling an in-depth genetic comparison. Strikingly, despite a very low prevalence of patient infections with blaKPC-positive organisms, all samples from the intensive care unit pipe wastewater and external manholes contained carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs), suggesting a vast, resilient reservoir. We observed a diverse set of species and plasmids, and we noted species and susceptibility profile differences between environmental and patient populations of CPOs. However, there were plasmid backbones common to both populations, highlighting a potential environmental reservoir of mobile elements that may contribute to the spread of resistance genes. Clear associations between patient and environmental isolates were uncommon based on sequence analysis and epidemiology, suggesting reasonable infection control compliance at our institution. Nonetheless, a probable nosocomial transmission of Leclercia sp. from the housekeeping environment to a patient was detected by this extensive surveillance. These data and analyses further our understanding of CPOs in the hospital environment and are broadly relevant to the design of infection control strategies in many infrastructure settings. IMPORTANCE Carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) are a global concern because of the morbidity and mortality associated with these resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Horizontal plasmid transfer spreads the resistance mechanism to new bacteria, and understanding the plasmid ecology of the hospital environment can assist in the design of control strategies to prevent nosocomial infections. A 5-year genomic and epidemiological survey was undertaken to study the CPOs in the patient-accessible environment, as well as in the plumbing system removed from the patient. This comprehensive survey revealed a vast, unappreciated reservoir of CPOs in wastewater, which was in contrast to the low positivity rate in both the patient population and the patient-accessible environment. While there were few patient-environmental isolate associations, there were plasmid backbones common to both populations. These results are relevant to all hospitals for which CPO colonization may not yet be defined through extensive surveillance. {\textcopyright} 2018, American Society for Microbiology.

This epidemic was centred in the area around Respublika Krim (Crimea) and Mykolajiv, and spread to include parts of southern Ukraine. Cases of cholera occurred between September and November of 1994 and between June and October of 1995. The 32 fatalities among 1370 recorded cases (case fatality ratio, 2.3%) occurred throughout the course of the epidemic. V. cholerae from patients with cholera produced cholera toxin and were resistant to multiple antibiotics, though no resistance plasmids were found. Conjugation experiments suggested that resistance to multiple antibiotics may be present on a self-transmissible genetic element. Environmental sources of V. cholerae O1 El Tor included sewage, sea and surface water, and fresh water and marine fish. All but one of the environmental V. cholerae isolated during the epidemic were very similar to selected isolates from patients at the same time, supporting the role of these environmental sources in the spread of disease.},

abstract = {Objectives: Enterococci are part of the microbial flora of the gastrointestinal tract of animals and human and can be released into the environment through fecal materials. These microorganisms play an important role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes. Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) have been obtained in municipal sewage, hospital and agricultural wastes and healthy carriers. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of VRE in sewage and fecal samples of healthy carriers. Methods: This study was performed on fecal specimens of 100 healthy carriers and 100 samples of sewage in Zanjan Province. Fecal and sewage samples were cultured on Trypticase Soy Agar and biochemical tests were performed for Enterococci identification. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed as CLSI guidelines and vancomycin resistance was determined using the agar dilution method. Results: Of 200 cultured samples, 141 isolates of Enterococci were detected. 64 isolates were detected from fecal and 77 were isolated from the sewage samples. Antibiotic resistance profile of fecal isolates was as follows: tetracycline (57.8%), ciprofloxacin (54.7%), phosphomycin (54.7%), erythromycin (51.5%), chloramphenicol (12.5%), amoxicillin (21.8%) and gatifloxacin (23.5%). Also for the sewage samples, the most antibiotic resistance was detected against ciprofloxacin (76.6%) followed by tetracycline (74%), erythromycin (68.8%), phos-phomycin (61%). According to Agar dilution method, among 141 isolates of Enterococci, 15 (10.6%) isolates were vancomycin resistant: 11 of sewage isolates (14.3%) and 4 of the carrier isolates (6.2%). Conclusion: Our study describes the high frequency of VRE in municipal sewage and healthy carriers. Regarding the importance of VRE strains in the clinical and environment, it seems necessary to follow up on the issue. {\textcopyright} 2019 Haghi et al.},

The samples were cultivated on MacConkey agar plates supplemented with meropenem. Individual colonies were examined for blaNDM, and blaNDM-positive bacteria were characterized based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from the Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms. Of 117 samples analyzed, the carriage rates for New Delhi metallo- b-lactamase (NDM)-positive Enterobacteriaceae were 47.1, 18, and 50% in geese, inanimate environments (sewage, soil, fodder, and dust), and mouse samples, respectively. Two variants (blaNDM-1 and blaNDM-5, in 4 and 40 isolates, respectively) were found among 44 blaNDM-positive Enterobacteriaceae, these variants belonged to eight species, and Escherichia coli was the most prevalent (50%). WGS analysis revealed that blaNDM coexisted with diverse antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Population structure analysis showed that most E. coli and Enterobacter sp. isolates were highly heterogeneous, while most Citrobacter sp. and P. stuartii isolates possessed extremely high genetic similarities. In addition, blaNDM-5-positive ST4358/ST48 E. coli isolates were found to be clonally spread between geese and the environment and were highly genetically similar to those reported from ducks, farm environments, and humans in China. Plasmid analysis indicated that IncX3 pHNYX644-1-like (n=40) and untypeable pM2-1-like plasmids (n = 4) mediated blaNDM spread. pM2-1-like plasmids possessed diverse ARGs, including blaNDM-1, the arsenical and mercury resistance operons, and the maltose operon. Our findings revealed that the goose farm is a reservoir for NDM-positive Enterobacteriaceae. The blaNDM contamination of wild mice and the novel pM2-1- like plasmid described here likely adds to the risk for dissemination of blaNDM and associated resistance genes. {\textcopyright} 2021, American Society for Microbiology.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers. The development of pathogenic bacteria encompassing antibiotics-resistant genes (ARGs) is a severe environmental concern related to human health. Among all antibiotics administered to humans, the $\beta$-lactam group's antibiotics account for two-thirds of the total weight due to its clinical effectiveness and low toxicity. This study investigated the abundance of gene NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase-1) as an emerging contaminant in Hyderabad, India's water bodies using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) method was applied to forecast the human health risk linked to ingestion/subjection of surface water with bacteria containing the NDM-1 gene. The gene copy number of the NDM-1 in the exposure route was taken into consideration for the determination of risk in best- and worst-case scenarios. The lowest and highest gene copy numbers were selected as the best-case scenario and the worst-case scenario, respectively. The outlet of Amberpet sewage treatment plant (STP) exhibited the lowest risk, 2×10-2, i.e., 2 of 100 people are exposed to infection. In contrast, Mir Alam tank lake exhibited the highest risk, 77×10-2, i.e., 77 of 100 people are exposed to infection. Risk assessment categorized the sampling locations into low, medium, and high risk of infection. Sampling areas with a low risk of infection included Amberpet STP outlet (2×10-2), Ameenpur lake (24×10-3), Manjeera water treatment plant (WTP) outlet (26×10-3), and Osman Sagar lake (24×10-3). Sampling locations with a medium risk of infection included Alwal lake (23×10-2), Durgamcheru lake (47×10-2), Hussain Sagar lake (21×10-2), Mominpet lake (27×10-2), and Saroor Sagar lake (43×10-2). Sampling zones including Fox Sagar lake (53×10-2), Himayat Sagar lake (70×10-2), Kandi lake (56×10-2), Manjeera dam (66×10-2), Mir Alam tank lake (77×10-2), Nagole lake (54×10-2), Safilguda lake (55×10-2), and Singur dam (57×10-2) were categorized as zones with a high risk of infection. The findings of the occurrence of the NDM-1 gene containing bacteria in water bodies surrounding Hyderabad and its related risk will be valuable for developing strategies to safeguard the public from the threat of clinical risks correlated with the dissemination of NDM-1.},

abstract = {Background and Objective: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is considered one of the most dangerous opportunistic bacteria worldwide, live in hospitals and other environments such as sewage water and soil and cause different infections include pneumonia. The main aim of this study was to investigate antibiotics susceptibility pattern and genotypic detection of virulence genes in P. aeruginosa isolates from clinical and environment sources. Materials and Methods: A total of 120 P. aeruginosa isolates were collected from two sources, 60 isolates from sputum of patients with pneumonia and 60 isolates from sewage water. Antibiotics susceptibility testing was done according to Kirby-Bauer method. Polymerase chain reaction technique was performed to detect the prevalence of six virulence-associated genes. Results: All 120 isolates (100%) were resistance to amoxicillin. While, imipenem was the best efficient antibiotic against clinical and sewage water isolates. Fifty five clinical isolates (91.6%) and 41 sewage water isolates (68.3%) were multi-drug resistance (MDR). The Pap A, Fim H, feoB, iutA, hly and kpsMTII genes prevalence in clinical isolates with percentages 91.6, 100, 80, 95, 20 and 100%, respectively, while the same genes prevalence in sewage water isolates with percentages, 51.6, 68.3, 41.6, 35, 3.3, 5 and 41.6%, respectively. Conclusion: This study suggested that there was positive correlation between the high prevalence of virulence-associated genes and increase of antibiotics resistance in P. aeruginosa isolates. {\textcopyright} 2018 Ahmed Abduljabbar Jaloob Aljanaby.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The importance of bacterial isolates from waste water environment as  a reservoir of antibiotic resistance and a potential source of novel resistance genes to clinical pathogens is underestimated. This study is aimed at to isolate and characterize public health important bacteria from waste water in hospital and non- hospital environments and evaluate the distribution of multiple drug resistance bacteria in the study area. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Gondar from January-June 2012. The hospital waste water was taken from different sections of the Gondar University Teaching Hospital. Non- hospital environment samples were taken at different sites of the university campuses, Gondar College of Teachers education, and soft drink factory in Gondar. Samples were aseptically collected, transported and processed with in two hours following standard procedure. Identified organisms were assessed for different antibiotics following Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. All data was registered and entered in to SPSS version 16 computer program. P-values less than 0.05 were taken as statistically significant. RESULT: A total of 60 waste water samples were processed for the presence of drug resistance pathogens. Among the total samples 113 bacterial isolates were recovered and of these 65 (57.5%) were from hospital environment and 48 (42.5%) were from non-hospital environment. The most frequently identified bacterium was Klebsiella spp. 30 (26.6%) followed by Pseudomonas spp. 19(16.8%), E. coli (11.5%) and Citrobacter spp (11.5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (8.2%). The over all prevalence of multiple drug resistance (MDR) in this study was 79/113 (69.9%). MDR in hospital environment was found to be 53/68 (81.5%) while in non hospital environment was found to be 26/48 (54.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple drug resistance to the commonly used antibiotics is high in the study area. The contamination of waste water by antibiotics or other pollutants lead to the rise of resistance due to selection pressure. The presence of antibiotic resistance organisms in this waste water should not be overlooked. Since this organisms may be vital to the safety and well-being of patients who are hospitalized and individual susceptible to infection. Therefore, proper waste water treatment plant should be established and improved sanitary measure should be practice.},

Enterococci were obtained from 75% of tested samples in SB media (72% in wastewater; 78% in surface-water), and 85 enterococcal isolates (one/positive-sample) were obtained. Enterococcus faecium was the most prevalent species (63.5%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (20%), Enterococcus hirae (9.4%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (4.7%), and Enterococcus gallinarum/Enterococcus durans (2.4%). Antibiotic resistance detected among these enterococci was as follows [percentage/detected gene (number isolates)]: kanamycin [29%/aph(3')-IIIa (n=22)], streptomycin [8%/ant(6)-Ia (n=4)], erythromycin [44%/erm(B) (n=34)], tetracycline [18%/tet(M) (n=6)/tet(M)-tet(L) (n=9)], chloramphenicol [2%/cat(A) (n=1)], ciprofloxacin [7%] and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [94%]. High-level-gentamicin resistant (HLR-G) enterococci were recovered from 15 samples in SB-Gen or SB plates [12/64 samples of wastewater (19%) and 3/50 samples of surface-water (6%)]; HLR-G isolates were identified as E. faecium (n=7), E. faecalis (n=6), and E. casseliflavus (n=2). These HLR-G enterococci carried the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2")-Ia and erm(B) genes, in addition to aph(3')-IIIa (n=10), ant(6)-Ia (n=9), tet(M) (n=13), tet(L) (n=8) and cat(A) genes (n=2). Three HLR-G enterococci carried the esp virulence gene. Sequence-types detected among HLR-G enterococci were as follows: E. faecalis (ST480, ST314, ST202, ST55, and the new ones ST531 and ST532) and E. faecium (ST327, ST12, ST296, and the new ones ST985 and ST986). Thirty-two different PFGE patterns were detected among 36 high-level-aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci recovered in water samples. Diverse genetic lineages of HLR-G enterococci were detected in wastewater and surface-water in Tunisia. Water can represent an important source for the dissemination of these antibiotic resistant microorganisms to other environments.},

abstract = {beta-lactam is the most used antibiotic class in the clinical area and
it acts on blocking the bacteria cell wall synthesis, causing cell
death. However, some bacteria have evolved resistance to these
antibiotics mainly due the production of enzymes known as
beta-lactamases. Hospital sewage is an important source of dispersion of
multidrug-resistant bacteria in rivers and oceans. In this work, we used
next-generation DNA sequencing to explore the diversity and
dissemination of serine beta-lactamases in two hospital sewage from Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil (South Zone, SZ and North Zone, NZ), presenting
different profiles, and to compare them with public environmental data
available. Also, we propose a Hidden-Markov-Model approach to screen
potential serine beta-lactamases genes (in public environments samples
and generated hospital sewage data), exploring its evolutionary
relationships. Due to the high variability in beta-lactamases, we used a
position-specific scoring matrix search method (RPS-BLAST) against
conserved domain database profiles (CDD, Pfam, and COG) followed by
visual inspection to detect conserved motifs, to increase the
reliability of the results and remove possible false positives. We were
able to identify novel beta-lactamases from Brazilian hospital sewage
and to estimate relative abundance of its types. The highest relative
abundance found in SZ was the Class A (50%), while Class D is
predominant in NZ (55%). CfxA (65%) and ACC (47%) types were the most
abundant genes detected in SZ, while in NZ the most frequent were OXA-10
(32%), CfxA (28%), ACC (21%), CEPA (20%), and FOX (19%).
Phylogenetic analysis revealed beta-lactamases from Brazilian hospital
sewage grouped in the same clade and close to sequences belonging to
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes groups, but distant from potential
beta-lactamases screened from public environmental data, that grouped
closer to beta-lactamases of Proteobacteria. Our results demonstrated
that HMM-based approach identified homologs of serine beta-lactamases,
indicating the specificity and high sensitivity of this approach in
large datasets, contributing for the identification and classification
of a large number of homologous genes, comprising possible new ones.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed the potential reservoir of beta-lactam
resistance genes in the environment, contributing to understanding the
evolution and dissemination of these genes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in different environments. METHODS: Clinical samples and stool samples from animal farms, sewage, human faecal carriers attending the emergency room and faecal carriers in the context of food-borne disease outbreaks were subcultured onto MacConkey agar supplemented with cefotaxime for the detection of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Identification, susceptibility pattern and ERIC-PCR were used for clone delineation in each sample. Community consumption of antibiotics was also recorded. RESULTS: An ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae prevalence of 1.9% was observed in human infections. A cross-sectional survey of human faecal carriers in the community showed a general prevalence of 6.6% with a temporal distribution. High use of antibiotics in winter coincided with a lower prevalence in carriers. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were detected in the five samples of human sewage, in samples from 8 of 10 pig farms, 2 of 10 rabbit farms, from all 10 poultry farms and in 3 of 738 food samples studied. Faecal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was detected in samples from 19 of 61 food-borne outbreaks evaluated. All food-borne outbreaks were due to enteropathogens. The prevalence of carriers in these outbreaks ranged from 4.4% to 66.6%. CONCLUSIONS: This widespread occurrence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae suggests that the community could act as a reservoir and that food could contribute to the spread of these strains.},

Characteristics analyzed were cultural activities, antimicrobial susceptibilities and capsule types. Comparison of both species revealed differences in adonitol fermentation and resistance to tetracycline, nalidixic and pipemidic acid. Capsule types 2, 7 and 33 were frequently found in K. pneumoniae, but not in K. oxytoca. On the other hand, K 66 was common in K. oxytoca, but not in K. pneumoniae. With regard to the source of isolation, clinical strains of both species proved to be more resistant to mezlocillin, azlocillin and cephalothin than fecal and sewage strains. Similarly, resistances of K. pneumoniae to cotrimoxazole, nalidixic and pipemidic acid were most frequent in clinical strains. Multiple drug resistances were found most often in clinical isolates. Biochemically, different frequencies of positive reactions for urease, lysine decarboxylase activity and acetoin production were found between the groups. Capsule typing demonstrated K2 and K7 in K. pneumoniae and K55 and K66 in K. oxytoca to be more common in clinical and fecal isolates than in sewage strains. While cultural characteristics did not allow discrimination of strains from different sources, capsule typing indicated clinical isolates to be more phenotypically related to strains from feces than to sewage isolates.},

abstract = {Dissemination of carbapenem resistance among pathogenic Gram-negative
bacteria is a looming medical emergency. Efficient spread of resistance
within and between bacterial species is facilitated by mobile genetic
elements. We hypothesized that wastewater contributes to the
dissemination of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), and
studied this through a cross-sectional observational study of wastewater
in the East of England. We isolated clinically relevant species of CPE
in untreated and treated wastewater, confirming that waste treatment
does not prevent release of CPE into the environment. We observed that
CPE-positive plants were restricted to those in direct receipt of
hospital waste, suggesting that hospital effluent may play a role in
disseminating carbapenem resistance. We postulated that plasmids
carrying carbapenemase genes were exchanged between bacterial hosts in
sewage, and used short-read (Illumina) and long-read (MinION)
technologies to characterize plasmids encoding resistance to
antimicrobials and heavy metals. We demonstrated that different CPE
species (Enterobacter kobei and Raoultella ornithinolytica) isolated
from wastewater from the same treatment plant shared two plasmids of 63
and 280 kb. The former plasmid conferred resistance to carbapenems
(bla(OXA-48)), and the latter to numerous drug classes and heavy metals.
We also report the complete genome sequence for Enterobacter kobei.
Small, portable sequencing instruments such as the MinION have the
potential to improve the quality of information gathered on
antimicrobial resistance in the environment.},

The prevalence of drug-resistance gene cassettes and diversity of arrays further proved that integrons were important contributors to the widespread occurrence of antibiotic resistance in E. coli among Jinan aquatic environments. {\textcopyright} IWA Publishing 2012.},

The tests showed that drain water flowing from residential areas is particularly rich in salmonella while only half of the drain water samples from a children's clinic revealed salmonella. The proportion of strains which are resistant to one or more antibiotics is lower among salmonella bred from sewer water than strains coming from human test material. Because of the test results, disinfection of hospital and slaughterhouse sewage is not considered necessary if it runs into the general sewer system.},

abstract = {This ecotaxonomic study compared the antibiotic tolerance among culturable oxytetracyline-resistant (Ot(r)) heterotrophic strains isolated from two aquatic environments representing human activities in health care and aquaculture, namely hospital effluents and freshwater fishfarms. Using a standardized methodology, samples taken in England and Ireland were analyzed to determine the antibiotic tolerance profiles of two groups of culturable Ot(r) bacterial isolates at the intergeneric and intrageneric level comprising heterotrophs (189 strains) and mesophilic Aeromonas spp. (153 strains), respectively. Antibiogram data of heterotrophic isolates revealed that Irish hospital strains comprised higher frequencies of multi-tolerance than those originating from fishfarm environments whereas a reverse correlation was found among the English heterotrophs. Polyphasic identification of the isolates using fatty acid analysis and API 20E profiling showed that this difference arose from the unique taxonomic diversity within each heterotrophic strain set. Acinetobacter (27%) and Brevundimonas (22%) were predominant among the Irish Ot(r) fishfarm isolates, whereas isolates originating from the English aquaculture site almost entirely consisted of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (86%) exhibiting high frequencies of tolerance to ampicillin and streptomycin. Within both the English and the Irish Ot(r) Aeromonas strain sets, on the other hand, the hospital strain sets displayed higher numbers of multi-tolerant isolates than to fishfarm isolates although country-specific differences were observed for individual antimicrobial agents. The typical occurrence of kanamycin-tolerant aeromonads in the Irish hospital site could to some extent be linked to the typical presence of A. hydrophila DNA hybridization group (HG) 3 strains as determined by fatty acid analysis and fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) fingerprinting. Essentially, these data indicate that tolerance profiles in a specific environment of one country do not necessarily reflect the corresponding tolerance profiles of the same type of environment in another country, and this mainly as a result of the unique taxonomic composition of each site. Ot(r) representatives of Acinetobacter, S. maltophilia, and A. veronii biovar sobria HG8 were common to most if not all of the four sites under study, indicating that these three taxa may serve as potential indicator organisms for monitoring antibiotic tolerance among indigenous bacterial populations in various aquatic environments.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has important implications for the continued use of antibiotics to control infectious diseases in both beef cattle and humans. AMR along the One Health continuum of the beef production system is largely unknown. Here, whole genomes of presumptive extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase E. coli (ESBL-EC) from cattle feces (n = 40), feedlot catch basins (n = 42), surrounding streams (n = 21), a beef processing plant (n = 4), municipal sewage (n = 30), and clinical patients (n = 25) are described. ESBL-EC were isolated from ceftriaxone selective plates and subcultured on ampicillin selective plates. Agreement of genotype-phenotype prediction of AMR ranged from 93.2% for ampicillin to 100% for neomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and enrofloxacin resistance. Overall, $\beta$-lactam (100%; blaEC, blaTEM-1, blaSHV, blaOXA, blaCTX-M-), tetracycline (90.1%; tet(A), tet(B)) and folate synthesis (sul2) antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were most prevalent. The ARGs tet(C), tet(M), tet(32), blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-14, blaOXA-1, dfrA18, dfrA19, catB3, and catB4 were exclusive to human sources, while blaTEM-150, blaSHV-11–12, dfrA12, cmlA1, and cmlA5 were exclusive to beef cattle sources. Frequently encountered virulence factors across all sources included adhesion and type II and III secretion systems, while IncFIB(AP001918) and IncFII plasmids were also common. Specificity and prevalence of ARGs between cattle-sourced and human-sourced presumptive ESBL-EC likely reflect differences in antimicrobial use in cattle and humans. Comparative genomics revealed phylogenetically distinct clusters for isolates from human vs. cattle sources, implying that human infections caused by ESBL-EC in this region might not originate from beef production sources. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of Enterobacteriaceae in different water environments of Guadeloupe and especially those impacted by waste water treatment plants (WWTP) effluents. The second objective was to characterize the genetic basis for antibiotic resistance of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates (ESBLE and AmpCE). METHODS: We have collected 70 surface waters (river and sea samples) impacted or not by WWTP and 18 waste waters from 2 WWTPs in 2012 and 2013. We i) determined the total and resistant bacterial counts and ii) tested isolated Enterobacteriaceae for their antimicrobial susceptibility. We also studied the genetic basis for antibiotic resistance of ESBLE and AmpCE, and the genetic background of Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In rivers, contamination with Escherichia coli and antibiotic resistant coliforms (ARC) increased from the source to the mouth. Highest levels of river contamination with E. coli (9.26 x 105 MPN/100mL) and ARC (2.26 x 108 CFU/mL) were observed in surface water sampled near the discharge. A total of 246 Enterobacteriaceae strains resistant to antibiotics were isolated, mostly from waste waters and from river water collected near the discharge. Among these strains, 33 were Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBLE) and 8 E. coli were AmpC beta-lactamase producers. All the ESBLE were isolated from waste waters or from river water collected near the discharge. The blaCTX-M gene was present in 29 of the 33 ESBLE strains, with 24 belonging to group 1. Numerous strains (68.7%) showed more than one acquired antibiotic resistance mechanism. E. coli strains belonged to different phylogenetic groups; among the B2 group, most strains belonged to the ST131 clone. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that many human activities can supply antibiotic-resistant bacteria in surface water. Nevertheless, WWTPs were the most important supplier of ESBLE in water environment of Guadeloupe.},

abstract = {The waste water treatment plant (WWTP) of the city of Bizerte concentrates different types of chemical and biological pollutants in the Bizerte lagoon (Tunisia). Considering four upstream and downstream WWTP discharge stations, seventy nine, culturable bacterial strains were isolated and identified from water and sediment as fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, pathogenic staphylococci and non-enterobacteriacea. Fecal coliforms were most abundant (2.5 10(5) bacteria/mg) in sediment of WWTP discharge. Leuconostoc spp (23.1%) and Chryseomonasluteola (23.1%) were the most prevalent culturable fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) isolated at the upstream discharge stations. However, Staphylococcus xylosus (13.9%) was the most prevalent culturable FIB isolated at the WWTP discharge stations. Moreover, high antibioticresistance phenotypes were present in all sampling stations, but especially in WWTP discharge station in both water and sediment. Resistance levels in water and sediment, respectively were amoxicillin (58.8%; 34.8%), penicillin (50%; 31.6%), oxacillin (60%; 33.3%), cefotaxim (55.2%; 39.1%), ceftazidim (66.7%; 50%), gentamycin (42.9%; 38.9%), tobramycin (50%; 25%), vancomycin (33.3; 71.4%), amikacin (66.7%; 0%) and ciprofloxacin (100%; 100%). Interestingly, ss-lactam antibiotic resistant FIB were mostly isolated from water as well as from sediments of upstream and WWTP discharge station. Canonical correspondence analysis CCA correlating antibiotic resistance profile with the abiotic data showed that, in water column, culturable bacterial strains isolated in upstream WWTP discharge stations were interestingly correlated with the resistance to amikacin, oxacillin, cefotaxim, ciprofloxacin and gentamycin, however, in sediment, they were correlated with the resistance to amoxicillin, oxacillin, cefotaxim and vancomycin. Serious ss-lactams and aminoglycosides acquired resistance appeared mainly in fecal streptococci and pathogen staphylococci groups.},

abstract = {This study identified differences in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) between wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) processing different proportions of hospital and municipal wastewater as well as various types of industrial wastewater. The influence of treated effluents discharged from WWTPs on the receiving water bodies (rivers) was examined. Genomic DNA was isolated from environmental samples (river water, wastewater and sewage sludge). The presence of genes encoding resistance to sulfonamides (sul1, sul2) and fluoroquinolones (qepA, aac(6')-Ib-cr) was determined by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The effect of the sampling season (summer - June, fall - November) was analyzed. Treated wastewater and sewage sludge were significant reservoirs of antibiotic resistance and contained all of the examined ARGs. All wastewater samples contained sul1 and aac(6')-lb-cr genes, while the qepA and sul2 genes occurred less frequently. These observations suggest that the prevalence of ARGs is determined by the type of processed wastewater. The Warmia and Mazury WWTP was characterized by higher levels of the sul2 gene, which could be attributed to the fact that this WWTP processes agricultural sewage containing animal waste. However, hospital wastewater appears to be the main source of the sul1 gene. The results of this study indicate that WWTPs are significant sources of ARGs, contributing to the spread of antibiotic resistance in rivers receiving processed wastewater. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

All enterococcal isolates were randomly selected except for the vancomycin-resistant ones. A total of 33 isolates of eight different bacterial genera were used as indicators for bacteriocin production. Forty-seven percent of the analyzed enterococcal isolates were bacteriocin producers (80.6% of E. faecalis and 21.6% of E. faecium isolates). The percentage of bacteriocin producers was higher among human clinical isolates (63.2%, 81.8% of vancomycin-resistant isolates and 60.5% of vancomycin-susceptible ones) than among isolates from the other origins (28 to 39.3%). Only one out of the 15 vancomycin-resistant isolates from human fecal samples was a bacteriocin producer, while 44.4% of fecal vancomycin-susceptible isolates were. The bacteriocin produced by the vanA-containing E. faecium strain RC714, named bacteriocin RC714, was further characterized. This bacteriocin activity was cotransferred together with the vanA genetic determinant to E. faecalis strain JH2-2. Bacteriocin RC714 was purified to homogeneity and its primary structure was determined by amino acid sequencing, showing an identity of 88% and a similarity of 92% with the previously described bacteriocin 31 from E. faecalis YI717. The presence of five different amino acids in bacteriocin RC714 suggest that this could be a new bacteriocin. The results obtained suggest that the epidemiology of vancomycin resistance may be influenced by different factors, including bacteriocin production.},

We hypothesized that Escherichia coli of human and beef cattle origins share the same pool of bla(CTX-M) genes. In this study, we aimed to assess and compare the genomic profiles of a larger collection of bla(CTX-M)-positive E. coli recovered from fecal composite samples from Canadian beef feedlot cattle and human wastewater through whole-genome sequencing. The variants bla(CTX-M-55), bla(CTX-M-32), bla(CTX-M-27), bla(CTX-M-15), and bla(CTX-M-14) were found in both urban wastewater and cattle fecal isolates. Core genome multilocus sequence typing showed little similarity between the fecal and wastewater isolates. Thus, if the dissemination of genes between urban wastewater and feedlot cattle occurs, it does not appear to be related to the expansion of specific clonal lineages. Further investigations are warranted to assemble and compare plasmids carrying these genes to better understand the modalities and directionality of transfer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative knowledge of microbiomes and resistomes across environmental  interfaces between animal production systems and urban settings is lacking. In this study, we executed a comparative analysis of the microbiota and resistomes of metagenomes from cattle feces, catch basin water, manured agricultural soil and urban sewage. RESULTS: Metagenomic DNA from composite fecal samples (FC; n = 12) collected from penned cattle at four feedlots in Alberta, Canada, along with water from adjacent catchment basins (CB; n = 13), soil (n = 4) from fields in the vicinity of one of the feedlots and urban sewage influent (SI; n = 6) from two municipalities were subjected to Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing. Firmicutes exhibited the highest prevalence (40%) in FC, whereas Proteobacteria were most abundant in CB (64%), soil (60%) and SI (83%). Among sample types, SI had the highest diversity of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and metal and biocide resistance (MBR) classes (13 & 15) followed by FC (10 & 8), CB (8 & 4), and soil (6 & 1). The highest antimicrobial resistant (AMR) gene (ARG) abundance was harboured by FC, whereas soil samples had a very small, but unique resistome which did not overlap with FC & CB resistomes. In the beef production system, tetracycline resistance predominated followed by macrolide resistance. The SI resistome harboured $\beta$-lactam, macrolide, tetracycline, aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone and fosfomycin resistance determinants. Metal and biocide resistance accounted for 26% of the SI resistome with a predominance of mercury resistance. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates an increasing divergence in the nature of the microbiome and resistome as the distance from the feedlot increases. Consistent with antimicrobial use, tetracycline and macrolide resistance genes were predominant in the beef production system. One of the feedlots contributed both conventional (raised with antibiotics) and natural (raised without antibiotics) pens samples. Although natural pen samples exhibited a microbiota composition that was similar to samples from conventional pens, their resistome was less complex.

abstract = {Real-time PCR assays were developed for the quantifiable detection of the antibiotic-resistance genes vanA of enterococci, ampC of Enterobacteriaceae, and mecA of staphylococci in different municipal wastewater samples. Primer and probe designs for these resistance genes were constructed and optimised for application in standardised TaqMan PCR assays. Using reference strains, the linear measurement ranges of the assays were defined and covered concentration ranges of five to seven exponential values. Wastewater isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and $\beta$-lactam-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were cultivated from municipal wastewaters in order to verify the specificity and sensitivity of the primer-probe systems. Additionally, clinical strains of staphylococci resistant to methicillin (MRSA) confirmed the applicability of the mecA-specific detection system. Total DNAs were extracted from five different wastewater treatment plants and used for direct TaqMan PCR detection of the resistance genes without prior cultivation. In municipal wastewater, the resistance gene vanA was detected in 21% of the samples, and ampC in 78%. The gene mecA was not found in municipal wastewater, but in two clinical wastewater samples. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of multiple-antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from hospitalized patients and from wastewaters, with and without treatment, discharged from eight hospitals and eight communities in Bangkok. A total of 320 wastewater samples were examined for the quantitative presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Significance differences (P< 0.05) in the number of samples and total numbers of organism per positive sample were observed between the treated and untreated samples or between the hospital and community wastewater samples. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in 35% of treated compared to 86.2% of untreated wastewater from the hospitals; and 57.5% of treated compared to 82.5% of untreated wastewater from the communities. Untreated hospital wastewaters gave the highest count. The resistance rates to 8 antibiotics were determined in 200 Ps. aeruginosa strains isolated from wastewaters, and 200 strains from hospitalized patients. There was no significant differences in resistance rates and resistance patterns between hospitalized patient and hospital wastewater strains (P>0.05). The prevalence of multiple resistance strains were significantly higher in strains from either hospitalized patients (51%) or hospital wastewaters (53%) than from community wastewaters (11%) (P<0.05). In conclusion, the study emphasizes the significance of hospital wastewater which, without effective treatment, may serve as reservoirs of multiple resistant Ps. aeruginosa which may spread into water environment and become a serious threat to public health. Surveillance and prudent use of antibiotics in the hospitals as well as the effective treatment of wastewater to reduce antibiotic-resistant bacteria are urgently needed for environmental and public health protection.},

abstract = {Background Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are an emerging infection control problem in hospitals worldwide. Identifying carriers may help reduce potential spread and infections. Aim To assess whether testing hospital wastewater for CPE can supplement patient-based screening for infection prevention purposes in a hospital without a recognized endemic CPE problem. Methods Wastewater collected from hospital pipework on 16 occasions during February to March 2014 was screened for CPE using chromID{\textregistered} CARBA agar and chromID{\textregistered} CPS agar with a 10 $\mu$g ertapenem disc and combination disc testing. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy methodology and carbapenemase genes detected by polymerase chain reaction or whole-genome sequencing. Selected isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Findings Suspected CPE were recovered from all 16 wastewater samples. Of 17 isolates sent to the Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections Reference Unit, six (four Citrobacter freundii and two Enterobacter cloacae complex) were New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (NDM) producers and the remaining 11 (six Klebsiella oxytoca and five Enterobacter cloacae complex) were Guiana-Extended-Spectrum-5 (GES-5) producers, the first to be described among Enterobacteriaceae in the UK. The four NDM-producing C. freundii, two NDM-producing E. cloacae complex, and four out of five GES-5-producing E. cloacae complex were each indistinguishable isolates of the same three strains, whereas the six GES-5-producing K. oxytoca overall shared 79% similarity. Conclusion CPE are readily isolated from hospital wastewater using simple culture methods. There are either undetected carriers of CPE excreting into the wastewater, or these CPE represent colonization of the pipework from other sources. Surveillance of hospital wastewater for CPE does not appear helpful for infection control purposes within acute hospitals. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Healthcare Infection Society},

Hospital WW (HWW) contain higher loads of micro-pollutants and AMR markers than urban WW (UWW). Little is known about the long-term dynamics of H and U WW and the impact of their joined treatment on the general burden of AMR. Here, we characterized the resistome, microbiota and eco-exposome signature of 126 H and U WW samples treated separately for three years, and then mixed, over one year. Multi-variate analysis and machine learning revealed a robust signature for each WW with no significant variation over time before mixing, and once mixed, both WW closely resembled Urban signatures. We demonstrated a significant impact of pharmaceuticals and surfactants on the resistome and microbiota of H and U WW. Our results present considerable targets for AMR related risk assessment of WW.

abstract = {Elements mediating VanA glycopeptide resistance in 106 diverse enterococci from humans and nonhuman sources were compared with the prototype VanA transposon, Tn1546, in Enterococcus faecium BM4147. The isolates included 64 from individual patients at 15 hospitals in the United Kingdom (isolated between 1987 and 1996) and 42 from nonhuman sources in the United Kingdom (27 from raw meat, 7 from animal feces, and 8 from sewage). VanA elements were assigned to 24 groups (designated groups A to X) with primers that amplified 10 overlapping fragments of Tn1546. Ten groups of elements were found only in human enterococci, eight groups of elements were unique to nonhuman strains, and six groups of elements were common in enterococci from all sources. Elements indistinguishable from Tn1546 (group A) were observed more frequently in enterococci from nonhuman sources (34 versus 9%) but were identified in enterococci that caused outbreaks in hospital patients between 1987 and 1995. The most common group found in human enterococci (group H; 33%) was rarely observed in enterococci from other sources (5%). Group H elements differed from Tn1546 in three regions and included a novel insertion sequence, designated IS1542, between orf2 and vanR. The VanA elements of 14 other groups had a similar insertion at this position and/or distinct insertions at other positions. We conclude that VanA elements in enterococci are heterogeneous, although all show regions of homology with Tn1546. Furthermore, the elements most common among the human and nonhuman enterococci studied were different. This approach may be useful for monitoring the evolution of VanA resistance and may also be applicable in local "snapshot" epidemiological studies. However, as transposition events involving insertion sequences accounted for the differences observed between several groups, the stability of the elements must be assessed before their true epidemiological significance can be determined.},

abstract = {F-type plasmids are diverse and of great clinical significance, often carrying genes conferring antimicrobial resistance (AMR) such as extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases, particularly in Enterobacterales. Organising this plasmid diversity is challenging, and current knowledge is largely based on plasmids from clinical settings. Here, we present a network community analysis of a large survey of F-type plasmids from environmental (influent, effluent and upstream/downstream waterways surrounding wastewater treatment works) and livestock settings. We use a tractable and scalable methodology to examine the relationship between plasmid metadata and network communities. This reveals how niche (sampling compartment and host genera) partition and shape plasmid diversity. We also perform pangenome-style analyses on network communities. We show that such communities define unique combinations of core genes, with limited overlap. Building plasmid phylogenies based on alignments of these core genes, we demonstrate that plasmid accessory function is closely linked to core gene content. Taken together, our results suggest that stable F-type plasmid backbone structures can persist in environmental settings while allowing dramatic variation in accessory gene content that may be linked to niche adaptation. The association of F-type plasmids with AMR may reflect their suitability for rapid niche adaptation. {\textcopyright} 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a threat to human life. Recently, sewers have been identified as potential reservoirs. The intermittent injection of sewage into adjacent surface waters is inevitable, due to capacity limitations of the urban drainage system. Information regarding the effect to natural freshwater biofilms (NFB) due to the intermittent contaminations are scarce. Therefore, a fundamental screening is necessary. In April, we placed NFB-attachment constructions in a brook upstream and downstream from urban drainage overflow constructions. In meanwhile two sampling campaigns were conducted. The sewage and the brook water were collected to gather information about antibiotic background exposure of ciprofloxacin (CIP), clarithromycin (CLA) and doxycycline (DOX). Six months later we experimentally determined the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) of the NFB-communities after a 24h lasting exposure with additionally dosed antibiotics. Concentrations of 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0mgL(-1) were selected. CIP, CLA and DOX were individually dosed, and also in mixtures. The mean antibiotic background concentration in sewage was in a range of 575.5-1289.1ngL(-1), which mainly exceeded the concentrations published in literature. The determined mean concentration in the brook was in a range of 4.6-539.0ngL(-1). The first significant inhibition of the OUR with individually dosed antibiotics started mainly at a concentration of 1.0mgL(-1). Antibiotics in a mixture with concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0mgL(-1) were as effective as single dosed antibiotics with a concentration of 10.0mgL(-1). The increased antibiotic tolerance and resistance of NFB-communities downstream of the combined sewer overflow (CSO) structure was a consequence of a severe impact due to urban drainage overflows. Hence, NFB-communities downstream of CSO-constructions are hot spots of antibiotic tolerant and resistant subpopulations and access restrictions should be announced, if an infection risk is present.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility profile of various bacterial  pathogens in the health facilities, abattoirs and related environment is important to assess potential risk of dissemination of resistant pathogens to the environment. There is limited information about antimicrobial susceptibility profile of common Enterobacteriaceae in waste water samples from hospitals, abattoirs and the downstream water bodies in Addis Ababa. The present study assessed antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from wastewater samples (WWS) of two hospitals: Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH) and Minilik II hospital, a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and an abattoir, and downstream rivers in Addis Ababa. RESULTS: A total of 54 bacterial isolates belonging to 6 species were identified: E.coli (32%), Salmonella 23%), Klebsiella pneumonia (15%), Enterobacter aerogenes (11%), Citrobacter (7%), Klebsiella oxytoca (6%) and Enterobacter cloacae (6%), respectively. Two strains of Citrobacter spp. isolated from TASH wastewater sample (WWS) were resistant to all 12 antimicrobials tested whereas an E. coli isolate from the same source was resistant to 11 antimicrobials. All isolates were resistant to 2 or more antimicrobials tested. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) to several antimicrobials was recorded, particularly in isolates obtained from hospital WWS and it was more common in Citrobacter and E. coli isolates. Extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL) production was detected in 27.3% of MDR isolates, all of them obtained from hospital effluents whereas none of the isolates were carbapenemase producers. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that Enterobacteriaceae in wastewater from hospitals, abattoir and downstream water bodies are resistant to commonly used antimicrobials. Hospital effluents contained more of MDR bacteria, posing significant public health threat through dissemination to the downstream water bodies.},

the burden of antimicrobial resistance in waste water effluents from
different sources and their impact on human health. Gram negative
bacteria were isolated from 30 samples each of industrial, hospital and
domestic effluents. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the 367 isolates
from 90 effluent samples was determined by disc diffusion test and
presence of antimicrobial resistance genes by polymerase chain reaction.
Resistance to ampicillin was 62% in hospital effluents and was higher
than that recorded for industrial and domestic effluents. While the
highest percentage of resistance to tetracycline was observed in
isolates from industrial effluents (42%) a low of 9.5% was observed in
hospital effluents. Antimicrobial resistance determinants present on
mobile genetic elements were observed in a small fraction ((similar
to)10%) of the resistant isolates. The resistance profile of isolates
in effluents reflect the practices of different industries. Resistant
isolates in domestic effluents could be a reflection of the
indiscriminate use of antibiotics andthat many of the contents of
disinfectants and cleaning agents routinely used may contain structural
analogs of antimicrobials used in therapy. Though by phenotypic test a
higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was recorded the genotypic
study revealed the prevalence to be low. This could be due to the
limited number of antimicrobial resistance genes included in this study.},

Gulbarga region is often prone to enteric fever outbreaks and is an endemic region of typhoid fever. Enteric fever caused by Salmonella Typhi has not been adequately explored in this region. Methodology: A total of 95 isolates of S. Typhi collected from different clinical and environmental sources were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility according to the CLSI guidelines. MIC of resistant isolates to various antibiotics was performed by agar dilution method. Results: Of the total isolates studied, 10% were found to be multidrug resistant (MDR) (defined as resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole). There was a decrease in the susceptibility to ciprofloxacin of S. Typhi with MIC showing an upward trend (0.125-4$\mu$ g/mL). Concurrently, there has been an increase in the number of isolates sensitive to all antibiotics except nalidixic acid. Conclusion: MDR S. Typhi continues to be an important public health issue in Gulbarga. Presence of quinolone resistance and associated low-level ciprofloxacin resistance is a concern and requires further study.

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is a growing public health concern in European hospitals and communities. Escherichia coli is one of the most common agents of bacterial infection which causes urinary tract infections as well as more serious infections (septicemia). The aim of the project is to investigate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli that are resistant to third generation cephalosporins, in waste water treatment plants in the Burgundy region and to monitor the impact of treated effluents on water quality in the Ouche watershed. CTX-M is a recently occurring ESBL, encoded by the blaCTX-M genes, which causes resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins (3GC). A regional strategy for sampling surface and ground waters had be carried out in relation to existing data, in order to evaluate the capacity of CTX-M producing E. coli to spread and survive in water resources. To characterize the dissemination of ESBL producing E. coli in the aquatic system, we selected several sampling points according to hydrogeological contexts, land use and waste water plants with a particular interest for karst aquifers that are predominant in the studied area. For each sampling point, we combined microbial and chemical approaches. Inorganic elements (including trace elements) were analyses completed by REE (ie Gadolinium anomaly) and pharmaceutical products (caffeine, carbamazepine, ibuprofen and acetaminophen). From the presence or absence of ESBL producing E. coli, we attempt to identify the sources and vectors of water contamination. The first results show the contamination of surface water with ESBL producing E. coli. This dissemination is associated with the discharge of treated sewage into the environment. Nevertheless, in alluvial aquifer transfers of E. coli is low to zero and ESBL producing E. coli is zero. In this context, surface water is filtrated by the river banks which prevent the E. coli migrationtoward ground water.

abstract = {Four indicator genes were monitored by quantitative PCR in hospital effluent (HE) and in the raw and treated wastewater of the municipal wastewater treatment plant receiving the hospital discharge. The indicator genes were the class 1 integrase gene intI1, to assess the capacity of bacteria to be involved in horizontal gene transfer processes; blaTEM, one of the most widespread antibiotic resistance genes in the environment, associated with Enterobacteriaceae; vanA, an antibiotic resistance gene uncommon in the environment and frequent in clinical isolates; and marA, part of a locus related to the stress response in Enterobacteriaceae. Variation in the abundance of these genes was analysed as a function of the type of water, and possible correlations with cultivable bacteria, antimicrobial residue concentrations, and bacterial community composition and structure were analysed. HE was confirmed as an important source of blaTEM and vanA genes, and wastewater treatment showed a limited capacity to remove these resistance genes. The genes blaTEM and vanA presented the strongest correlations with culturable bacteria, antimicrobial residues and some bacterial populations, representing interesting candidates as indicator genes to monitor resistance in environmental samples. The intI1 gene was the most abundant in all samples, demonstrating that wastewater bacterial populations hold a high potential for gene acquisition. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer.

abstract = {acquired infections. Sewage acts as an environmental reservoir and may have a significant role in development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance. Objectives: This study was undertaken to determine the epidemiological relatedness between the MRSA isolated from sewage and human infections. Materials and Methods: Samples were collected from a referral hospital and also a sewage treatment plant in Tehran, Iran, during 2010. All the MRSA isolates were identified at the species level and typed using Phene plate (PhP) system and SCCmec typing. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were also performed. Results: Of the 1142 isolates, 200 MRSA strains from the sewage (n = 100) and the clinic (n = 100) were isolated. Distinct PhP types, consisting of 16 common types and 13 single types, and also 3 different staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) types (III, IVa and IVc) were found amongst the MRSA isolated from the two different sources. The results of antibiotic susceptibility testing showed an increased resistance to penicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline. In addition, none of the isolates showed resistance to vancomycin, quinupristin -dalfopristin and linezolid. Conclusions: The presence of common PhP types and also SCCmec type III, as an indicator for hospital strains, among the isolates, may indicate an epidemiological link between clinical and sewage MRSA isolates in Tehran. {\textcopyright} 2015, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences.},

of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Enterococci are members of the
gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals and represent important
reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes. Until today, few studies have
examined antibiotic susceptibility in enterococci isolated from
primates. Therefore, the present study investigated species
distribution, antibiotic susceptibility, and resistance genes in
enterococci isolated from wild and captive black capuchins monkeys
(Sapajus nigritus) in Rio Grande do Sul, South Brazil. A total of 24
swabs/fecal samples were collected, including 19 from wild monkeys
living in two forest fragments {[}Sao Sebastiao do Cal (SSC) and Santa
Cruz do Sul (SCS)], and five in captive {[}Parque Zoologico da Fundacao
Zoobotanica (ZOO)], between August 2016 and November 2017. Fifteen
colonies were randomly selected from each sample. Enterococci were
identified by MALDI-TOF, tested for susceptibility to 12 antibiotics;
and screened for tet(S), tet(M), tet(L), msrC, and erm(B) genes by PCR.
Two-hundred ninety-six enterococci were isolated (SSC n = 137; SCS n =
86; ZOO n = 73) and differences in Enterococcus species distribution
were detected on three monkey groups, with low abundance in SCS (1 - D =
0.2), followed by ZOO (1 - D = 0.68), and SSC (1 - D = 0.73). The
enterococci frequently recovered include the following: Enterococcus
faecalis (42.6%), E. hirae (29.1%), and E. faecium (15.9%).
Antibiotic-nonsusceptible was observed in 202 (67.9%) strains. The rate
of non-susceptibility to rifampicin, tetracycline, erythromycin,
nitrofurantoin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin was 46%, 26%, 22% and
19%, 13%, 0.3%, and 0.3%, respectively. All strains were susceptible
to vancomycin, streptomycin, gentamycin, and linezolid. Forty-three
(14.52%) isolates were identified as multidrug resistant (MDR), and the
highest number of MDR enterococci were E. faecium recovered from wild
monkeys living close to a hospital and water treatment plant. Elevated
rates of antibiotic resistance genes msrC and tet(L) were isolates from
ZOO. In conclusion, differences in the frequency of enterococci species,
antibiotic-nonsusceptible and antibiotic resistance genes in all groups
of monkeys were identified. These data suggest that anthropogenic
activities could have an impact in the resistome of primate gut
enterococci communities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram-negative bacterial species capable of occupying a broad range of environmental and clinical habitats. Known as an opportunistic pathogen, it has recently become a major causative agent of clinical infections worldwide. Despite growing knowledge about the highly diverse population of K. pneumoniae, the evolution and clinical significance of environmental K. pneumoniae, as well as the relationship between clinical and environmental K. pneumoniae, are poorly defined. METHODS: We isolated and sequenced K. pneumoniae from in-patients in a single hospital in Thailand, as well as hospital sewage, and surrounding canals and farms within a 20-km radius. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of 77 K. pneumoniae (48 clinical and 29 non-clinical isolates) demonstrated that the two groups were intermixed throughout the tree and in some cases resided in the same clade, suggesting recent divergence from a common ancestor. Phylogenetic comparison of the 77 Thai genomes with 286 K. pneumoniae from a global collection showed that Thai isolates were closely related to the clinical sub-population of the global collection, indicating that Thai clinical isolates belonged to globally circulating lineages. Dating of four Thai K. pneumoniae clades indicated that they emerged between 50 and 150 years ago. Despite their phylogenetic relatedness, virulence factors and beta-lactamase resistance genes were more numerous in clinical than in environmental isolates. Our results indicate that clinical and environmental K. pneumoniae are closely related, but that hospitals may select for isolates with a more resistant and virulent genotype. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the clinical relevance of environmental K. pneumoniae isolates.},

Epilithic biofilms were collected downstream from 12 WWTPs of various types and capacities to study the impacts of their discharge through the changes in biofilm composition (compared to a corresponding upstream biofilm) in terms of pharmaceutical concentrations and bacterial community modifications (microbial diversity and resistance integrons). The biofilm is a promising indicator to evaluate the impacts of WWTPs on the surrounding aquatic environment. Indeed, the use of biofilms reveals contamination hot spots. All of the downstream biofilms present significant concentrations (up to 965ng/g) of five to 11 pharmaceuticals (among the 12 analysed). Moreover, the exposition to the discharge point increases the presence of resistance integrons (three to 31 fold for Class 1) and modifies the diversity of the bacterial communities (for example cyanobacteria). The present study confirms that the discharge from WWTPs has an impact on the aquatic environment.},

Enteric bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, were isolated from clinical sources (urinary tract and gastrointestinal tract infections; 80 isolates) and hospital wastewater (103 isolates). The antibiotic resistance profile and ESBL production of the isolates were investigated by disc diffusion assay and combined disc diffusion test, respectively. Plasmid profiling was performed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and elimination of resistance markers was performed by a plasmid curing experiment. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed a high incidence of beta-lactam resistance, being highest to ampicillin (88.0%) followed by amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, cefpodoxime, cefotaxime, aztreonam, cefepime and ceftazidime. Among the non-beta-lactam antibiotics, the highest resistance was recorded to nalidixic acid (85.7%). Moreover, 50.8% of enteric bacteria showed resistance to ciprofloxacin. Among 183 total enteric bacteria, 150 (82.0%) exhibited multidrug resistance. ESBL production was detected in 78 isolates (42.6%). A significantly higher incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance was observed among ESBL-producing enteric bacteria both in clinical (P=0.0015) and environmental isolates (P=0.012), clearly demonstrating a close association between ESBL production and ciprofloxacin resistance. Plasmid profiling of selected ESBL-positive strains indicated the presence of one or more plasmids of varying sizes. Plasmid curing resulted in loss of ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime resistance markers simultaneously from selected ESBL-positive isolates, indicating the close relationship of these markers. This study revealed a common occurrence of ciprofloxacin-resistant ESBL-producing enteric bacteria both in hospital wastewater and clinical sources, indicating a potential public health threat.},

abstract = {Treated wastewater discharged into the environment acts as a disturbance of the  natural microbial communities in terms of taxonomic composition and of functional gene pool, including antibiotic resistance genes. We tested whether stochastic and heterogeneous site-specific trajectories or generalities, potentially driven by deterministic processes, control the fate of allochthonous bacteria from anthropogenic sources and the persistence of their functional traits in freshwater. Finding generalities would allow the identification of wastewater treatments that could be effective in abating determinants of antibiotic resistance. We analysed the short-term response of native bacterial communities in waters exposed to the disturbance of wastewater at different dilutions, using a metagenomic approach that revealed both microbial community composition and the scope and abundance of the resistome that can pose indirect risks to human health. We found that the taxonomic composition of the communities after the disturbance was driven by case-specific stochastic processes, whereas the resistome had a deterministic trajectory, rapidly stabilising its functional traits with higher proportions of wastewater effluents, regardless of differences in taxonomic composition, richness of antibiotic resistance genes and of bacterial taxa, phenotypic features of the bacterial communities, and type of wastewater treatment. The observed deterministic proliferation of resistomes in freshwater bodies receiving wastewater effluents, suggests that this process may contribute to the global propagation of antibiotic resistance, and thus calls for new legislations promoting alternative tertiary treatments for the wastewater reuse, and targeting bacterial functional traits and not only bacterial abundances.},

To protect human health proactively, and in a cost-efficient way, water authorities and drinking water companies need early warning systems. This study aimed to (1) assess the effectiveness of screening the scientific literature to direct sampling campaigns for early warning purposes, and (2) detect new aquatic contaminants of concern to public health in the Netherlands. By screening the scientific literature, six example contaminants (3 chemical and 3 microbial) were selected as potential aquatic contaminants of concern to the quality of Dutch drinking water. Stakeholders from the Dutch water sector and various information sources were consulted to identify the potential sources of these contaminants. Based on these potential contamination sources, two sampling sequences were set up from contamination sources (municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants), via surface water used for the production of drinking water to treated drinking water. The chemical contaminants, mycophenolic add, tetrabutylphosphonium compounds and Hexafluoropropylene Oxide Trimer Acid, were detected in low concentrations and were thus not expected to pose a risk to Dutch drinking water. Colistin resistant Escherichia coli was detected for the first time in Dutch wastewater not influenced by hospital wastewater, indicating circulation of bacteria resistant to this last-resort antibiotic in the open Dutch population. Four out of six contaminants were thus detected in surface or wastewater samples, which showed that screening the scientific literature to direct sampling campaigns for both microbial and chemical contaminants is effective for early warning purposes.

The role of the environment in the overall rise in antibiotic-resistant infections and risk to humans is largely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate drivers of antibiotic-resistance levels across the River Thames catchment, model key biotic, spatial and chemical variables and produce predictive models for future risk assessment. Sediment samples from 13 sites across the River Thames basin were taken at four time points across 2011 and 2012. Samples were analysed for class 1 integron prevalence and enumeration of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant bacteria. Class 1 integron prevalence was validated as a molecular marker of antibiotic resistance; levels of resistance showed significant geospatial and temporal variation. The main explanatory variables of resistance levels at each sample site were the number, proximity, size and type of surrounding wastewater-treatment plants. Model 1 revealed treatment plants accounted for 49.5% of the variance in resistance levels. Other contributing factors were extent of different surrounding land cover types (for example, Neutral Grassland), temporal patterns and prior rainfall; when modelling all variables the resulting model (Model 2) could explain 82.9% of variations in resistance levels in the whole catchment. Chemical analyses correlated with key indicators of treatment plant effluent and a model (Model 3) was generated based on water quality parameters (contaminant and macro- and micro-nutrient levels). Model 2 was beta tested on independent sites and explained over 78% of the variation in integron prevalence showing a significant predictive ability. We believe all models in this study are highly useful tools for informing and prioritising mitigation strategies to reduce the environmental resistome.},

extended spectrum cephalosporinase (ESC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in
aquatic environments are poorly documented. This study investigated the
occurrence, concentrations and characteristics of ESC-producing E. coil
(ESC-Ec) in samples of surface water collected at five Swedish water
treatment plants that normally have relatively high prevalence and
concentration of E. coli in surface water. ESC-Ec was found in 27 of 98
surface water samples analysed. All but two positive samples were
collected at two of the water treatment plants studied. The ESC-Ec
concentration, 1-3 cfu/100 mL, represented approximately 4% of the
total amount of E. coil in the respective surface water sample. In
total, 74% of the isolates were multi-resistant, but no isolate was
resistant to carbapenems. Six types of ESBL/pAmpC genes were found in
the 27 E. coil isolates obtained from the positive samples, of which
four (bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CMY-2,) bla(CTX-M-1) and bla(CTX-M-14)) were
found during the whole sampling period, in samples taken at more than
one water treatment plant. In addition, the genes were situated on
various types of plasmids and most E. coil isolates were not closely
related with regard to MLST types. The combinations of ESBL/pAmpC genes,
plasmids and E. coli isolates were generally similar to those found
previously in healthy and sick individuals in Sweden. In conclusion, the
occurrence of ESC-Ec in Swedish surface water shows that resistant
bacteria of clinical concern are present in aquatic environments even in
a low-prevalence country such as Sweden. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Two ribotyping patterns were found among isolates from animals and sewage and those from clinical sources. A blood and a urine isolate from separate hospital patients and porcine isolates shared the same ribotyping pattern number 6 and a stool isolate from a patient in the community and sewage isolates shared another pattern, number 10. This finding suggests that animals may serve as a reservoir of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), which may enter the human food chain. The emergence of VRE in hospital patients may reflect selection of these organisms in the hospital environment by antibiotic usage from which nosocomial spread might occur.},

abstract = {The alga Cladophora glomerata can erupt in nuisance blooms throughout the lower Great Lakes. Since bacterial abundance increases with the emergence and decay of Cladophora, we investigated the prevalence of antibiotic resistance (ABR) in Cladophora-associated bacterial communities up-gradient and down-gradient from a large sewage treatment plant (STP) on Lake Ontario. Although STPs are well-known sources of ABR, we also expected detectable ABR from up-gradient wetland communities, since they receive surface run-off from urban and agricultural sources. Statistically significant differences in aquatic bacterial abundance and ABR were found between down-gradient beach samples and up-gradient coastal wetland samples (ANOVA, Holm-Sidak test, p < 0.05). Decaying and free-floating Cladophora sampled near the STP had the highest bacterial densities overall, including on ampicillin- and vancomycin-treated plates. However, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of the ABR genes ampC, tetA, tetB, and vanA from environmental communities showed a different pattern. Some of the highest ABR gene levels occurred at the 2 coastal wetland sites (vanA). Overall, bacterial ABR profiles from environmental samples were distinguishable between living and decaying Cladophora, inferring that Cladophora may control bacterial ABR depending on its life-cycle stage. Our results also show how spatially and temporally dynamic ABR is in nearshore aquatic bacteria, which warrants further research.},

The highest levels of resistance and multiresistance were found for clinical and river isolates. A wider number of resistance markers, observed for environment isolates with respect to human and animal isolates, made it possible to hypothesis e that the resistant strains could possess some selective advantage that enhances their survival in the environment. Association of antibiotic resistance and metal-resistance has been demonstrated in all isolates but it is particularly evident in the environment and clinical isolates. Correlation analysis revealed that the patterns of antibiotic and metal resistance of environmental E. coli isolates are in good agreement with those of human origin and that sewage and river E. coli isolates are well correlated too.},

Molecular characterization of Tn1546 elements in vanA VREF was performed using a combination of restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing of the internal PCR fragments of vanA transposons. Long-PCR amplification showed that the molecular size of Tn1546 elements varied from 10.8 to 12.8 kb. The molecular analysis of Tn1546 showed that 45 isolates (31.5%) harbored a deletion/mutation upstream from nucleotide 170. No horizontal transfer of Tn1546 was observed following filter-mating conjugation with these isolates. Nevertheless, the rates of transferability for other isolates were 10(-5) to 10(-6) per donor. Insertion sequences IS1216V and IS1542 were present in 103 (72%) and 138 (96.5%) of the isolates, respectively. The molecular analysis of Tn1546 elements resulted in three genomic organizations. The genomic organization lineage 1 was dominated by the isolates from clinical samples (3.4%), lineage 2 was dominated mostly by sewage isolates (24.5%), and lineage 3 contained isolates obtained from all sources (72.1%). The genetic diversity determined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed a single E. faecium clone, designated 44, which was common to the samples obtained from clinical specimens and hospital and municipal sewage. Furthermore, the results suggest that lineage 3 Tn1546 was highly disseminated among our enterococcal isolates in different PFGE patterns.},

Only a little is known about the dissemination of resistance determinants and changes in soil microbial communities affected by wastewater irrigation. Community DNAs from Mezquital Valley soils under irrigation with untreated wastewater for 0 to 100 years were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR for the presence of sul genes, encoding resistance to sulfonamides. Amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes from community DNAs from soils irrigated for 0, 8, 10, 85, and 100 years was performed and revealed a 14% increase of the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in rainy season soils and a 26.7% increase in dry season soils for soils irrigated for 100 years with wastewater. In particular, Gammaproteobacteria, including potential pathogens, such as Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, and Acinetobacter spp., were found in wastewater-irrigated fields. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 96 isolates from soils irrigated with wastewater for 100 years (48 from dry and 48 from rainy season soils) revealed that 46% were affiliated with the Gammaproteobacteria (mainly potentially pathogenic Stenotrophomonas strains) and 50% with the Bacilli, whereas all 96 isolates from rain-fed soils (48 from dry and 48 from rainy season soils) were affiliated with the Bacilli. Up to six types of antibiotic resistance were found in isolates from wastewater-irrigated soils; sulfamethoxazole resistance was the most abundant (33.3% of the isolates), followed by oxacillin resistance (21.9% of the isolates). In summary, we detected an increase of potentially harmful bacteria and a larger incidence of resistance determinants in wastewater-irrigated soils, which might result in health risks for farm workers and consumers of wastewater-irrigated crops.},

The habitats with the most diversified genotypes of quinolone-resistant E. coli, corresponding to the highest genetic diversity (H′), were wastewater and gulls. In addition, genetically distinct populations were observed in clinical samples and birds of prey, suggesting the influence of the habitat or selective pressures on quinolone-resistant E. coli. The close genetic relatedness between isolates of clinical origin and from gulls and wastewater suggests the existence of potential routes of propagation between these sources. The most common sequence types were ST131 and ST10, with ST131 being highly specific to patients, although distributed in all of the other habitats except birds of prey. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was significantly higher in isolates from patients and gulls than from other sources (P < 0.01), suggesting that the effect of selective pressures met by isolates subjected to strong human impacts. The evidence presented suggests the potential circulation of bacteria between the environmental and clinical compartments, with gulls being a relevant vector of bacteria and resistance genes. {\textcopyright} 2015 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer.},

Arcobacter butzleri and Arcobacter cryaerophilus are the species most frequently isolated from food of animal origin and from other samples. The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of arcobacters isolated in the Czech Republic. No information about antibiotic susceptibility and multidrug resistance of arcobacters isolated in the Czech Republic is available in the literature before now. Methods The antimicrobial resistance of A. butzleri (n = 80) and A. cryaerophilus (n = 20) isolated from meat of animal origin, water sources and clinical samples was examined by the disk diffusion method. Results Arcobacters were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents in 99% (99/100) of tested isolates. Most of the Arcobacter isolates were resistant to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics, i.e. ampicillin (81.0%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (28.0%), cefalotin (73.0%) and aztreonam (93.0%). Arcobacters were also frequently resistant to lincosamides, i.e. clindamycin (98.0%). Of the aminoglycosides, amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin were evaluated to be the most effective antibiotics among those tested against arcobacters. Conclusions These results demonstrate substantial resistance in Arcobacter isolates to 18 antimicrobial agents commonly used in medical and veterinary medicine. Multidrug resistance was found in 93.8% (75/80) of A. butzleri isolates and 70.0% (14/20) of A. cryaerophilus isolates. {\textcopyright} 2017 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer},

METHODS AND RESULTS: During 1 year study (September 2005-2006), a total of 106 HLGR-EF isolates were collected from clinical (n = 48) and STP (n = 58) samples in Tehran, Iran. Biochemical fingerprinting of these isolates using the PhP showed the presence of 21 PhP types (diversity index, Di = 0.97) among the clinical and 21 PhP types (Di = 0.91) among the STP isolates. Representative isolates of each PhP type (n = 42) were further characterized by the ribotyping method. Sixteen ribotypes were identified among the isolates with five types shared between the clinical and STP isolates. PFGE recognized 24 clonal types among these isolates with three pulsotypes shared between the clinical and STP isolates. Combination of the two techniques (PFGE and ribotyping) resulted in 24 (Di = 0.96) and 16 (Di = 0.93) types among the strains isolated from clinical and STP samples, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the combination of PhP typing, ribotyping and PFGE could be extremely discriminatory when examining HLGR-EF isolates. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The emergence of highly diverse HLGR-EF population in Iran is of serious concern especially because of their multi-resistances.},

Wastewater samples were collected between June 2015 and March 2016 in the sewage network of the city of Basel (Switzerland) from sites located before and after influx of wastewater from the hospital into the sewage network. Samples were also obtained from the influent and effluent of the receiving wastewater treatment plant. Samples were screened for CPE and MPB using selective media. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Carbapenemase and 16S rRNA methylase genes were identified by PCR and sequencing. Resistance profiles were determined by the disk diffusion test and Etest. The occurrence of CPE and MPB was increased downstream of hospital wastewater influx. Of 49 CPE isolates, 9 belonged to OXA-48-producing E. coli clone D:ST38, 7 were OXA-48-producing Citrobacter freundii, and 6 were KPC-2- or OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae belonging to clonal complex 258. NDM (NDM-1, -5 and -9) and VIM (VIM-1) producers were detected sporadically. MPB included ArmA- and RmtB-producing E. coli and Citrobacter spp. Isolates corresponding to strains from wastewater were detected in the effluent of the treatment plant. Conclusively, CPE and MPB, predominantly OXA-48-producing Enterobacteriaceae, are readily detected in wastewater, survive wastewater treatment and are released into the aquatic environment.

Pilot plant experiences of tertiary treatments added to conventional urban wastewater treatment plants (UWWTPs) have been carried out, in order to test the suitability of different disinfection technologies to reach the standards required for an effluent to be reused. In addition other parameters affecting the quality of reclaimed water, and for which there is currently no regulation or control, have been investigated; among them, antibiotic resistant bacteria concentration. To evaluate the extent of problems related to antibiotic resistant bacteria and the effectiveness of tertiary treatment on their abatement level, a significant portion of the wastewater network of the city of LAquila (Italy) and the related wastewater treatment plant were monitored. Antibiotic resistant bacteria content in non-treated sewage from municipal hospital and residential areas was evaluated. The UWWTP treating this sewage is of activated sludge type and is located near the Aterno River. The wastewater coming from the secondary treatment and from the tertiary treatments was analysed in order to investigate the influence on the antibiotic-resistant bacteria content.

abstract = {Klebsiella species occupy a wide range of environmental and animal niches, and  occasionally cause opportunistic infections that are resistant to multiple antibiotics. In particular, Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kpne) has gained notoriety as a major nosocomial pathogen, due principally to the rise in non-susceptibility to carbapenems and other beta-lactam antibiotics. Whilst it has been proposed that the urban water cycle facilitates transmission of pathogens between clinical settings and the environment, the level of risk posed by resistant Klebsiella strains in hospital wastewater remains unclear. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to compare Klebsiella species in contemporaneous samples of wastewater from an English hospital and influent to the associated wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). As we aimed to characterize representative samples of Klebsiella communities, we did not actively select for antibiotic resistance (other than for ampicillin), nor for specific Klebsiella species. Two species, Kpne and K. (Raoultella) ornithinolytica (Korn), were of equal dominance in the hospital wastewater, and four other Klebsiella species were present in low abundance in this sample. In contrast, despite being the species most closely associated with healthcare settings, Kpne was the dominant species within the WWTP influent. In total, 29 % of all isolates harboured the bla (OXA-48) gene on a pOXA-48-like plasmid, and these isolates were almost exclusively recovered from the hospital wastewater. This gene was far more common in Korn (68 % of isolates) than in Kpne (3.4 % of isolates). In general plasmid-borne, but not chromosomal, resistance genes were significantly enriched in the hospital wastewater sample. These data implicate hospital wastewater as an important reservoir for antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella, and point to an unsuspected role of species within the Raoultella group in the maintenance and dissemination of plasmid-borne bla (OXA-48).

abstract = {Introduction: Against the background of the increasing prevalence of strains of common pathogenic bacteria resistant to reserve antibiotics like carbapenem and colistin and the increasing numbers of reports of the occurrence of these bacteria in the environment, in water bodies and in sewage, the BMBF-funded research project HyReKA was implemented. The aim of this research project is to assess the quantitative and qualitative contamination of wastewater with and without the impact of effluents from hospital and/or from agricultural plants, of water bodies and wastewater treatment plants (with consideration of their microbial reduction performance) with regard to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, antibiotic resistance and antibiotic residues by means of cultural, molecular, molecular genetic and chemical-analytical methods. Preliminary results: Wastewaters exposed to hospital effluents show a considerably higher contamination by Gram-negative bacteria with antibiotic resistance including resistance against carbapenems and colistin. Wastewater treatment reduces the microbial load of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by 2 - 3 log10 steps. This means that antibiotic-resistant bacteria will remain in wasterwaters at lower concentrations even after treatment and thus can be discharged to water bodies. Wastewater from hospitals is a definite "hot spot" source for bacteria with resistance against reserve antibiotics. Conclusion: The occurrence of bacteria with resistance to "reserve group" antibiotics and the possible consequences concerning risk management of bathing water quality, drinking water hygiene, and for hospital hygiene have not been evaluated until today from a hygienic medical perspective. Concerning the consequences for risk regulation we propose a preliminary risk assessment from a hygienic medical perspective which needs to be evaluated and consented when the HyReKA project will be finished. {\textcopyright} mhp Verlag GmbH, Wiesbaden, 2018.

abstract = {Background: Aminoglycoside antibiotics are widely used in medical
centers, particularly to treat infections. The resistance developed
against these agents is a huge concern in health care. A number of
researchers have reported that hospital and municipal wastewaters are
among the most important dissemination sources of these agent into the
environment. Some, however, do not agree with this opinion. In the
present study, the prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance genes was
investigated in raw and effluent wastewater from hospital and municipal
wastewater treatment plants.
Methods: To conduct this descriptive-analytical study, 30 samples were
taken according to sampling principles and cold cycle and transferred to
the molecular laboratory. DNA was extracted by the freeze-thaw method
using a kit (Promega). The genes aac(3)-IIa and aac(6')-Ib which code
aminoglycoside resistance were examined in this study.
Results: The results indicated that the studied genes are present in
35\% of urban and hospital wastewaters, and their frequency percentage
is higher in hospital wastewater (52\%) than urban wastewater (48\%).
The studied genes were identified in 61\% of raw hospital wastewater
samples; however, they were not detected in the output wastewater from
the studied treatment plants.
Conclusion: Although, the studied genes were not detected in the final
effluent, there is a high potential for their release into the
environment. The current study demonstrated that the coding genes of
aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance are present in raw urban and
hospital wastewaters. In the case of improper exploitation of wastewater
treatment plants, the output water can contaminate other environmental
sections, such as soil and water resources, and result in the emission
of these contaminants.},

abstract = {Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are an emerging global problem that threatens to undermine important advances in modern medicine. The environment is likely to play an important role in the dissemination of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) among both environmental and pathogenic bacteria. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) accumulate both chemical and biological waste from the surrounding urban milieu and have therefore been viewed as potential hotspots for dissemination and development of antibiotic resistance. To assess the effect of wastewater effluent on a river that flows through a Swedish city, sediment and water samples were collected from St{\aa}ng{\aa}n River, both upstream and downstream of an adjacent WWTP over 3 mo. Seven ARGs and the integrase gene on class 1 integrons were quantified in the collected sediment using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to assess the abundance of 10 different antibiotics in the water phase of the samples. The results showed an increase in ARGs and integrons downstream of the WWTP. The measured concentrations of antibiotics were low in the water samples from the St{\aa}ng{\aa}n River, suggesting that selection for ARGs did not occur in the surface water. Instead, the downstream increase in ARGs is likely to be attributable to accumulation of genes present in the treated effluent discharged from the WWTP.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that human activity, and especially the resulting effluent, has a major role in the dissemination of bacterial antibiotic-resistance determinants in the environment. Hospitals are the major antibiotic consumers and thus facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance. Questions are increasingly being raised about the management of hospital effluents, but their involvement in antibiotic-resistance dissemination has never been assessed. Integrons are a paradigm of genetic transfer between the environmental resistome and both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. In order to assess the impact of hospital activities on antibiotic-resistance dissemination in the environment, we monitored integrons and their gene cassettes in hospital effluents, and their release in the environment. We found that bacterial communities present in a hospital effluent contained a high proportion of integrons. In terms of both their gene cassette diversity and gene cassette arrays, the urban effluent and municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent were most similar, whereas the hospital effluent and recirculation sludge exhibited very specific patterns. We found that anthropogenic activities led to the release of abundant integrons and antibiotic-resistance gene cassettes, but we observed no specific impact of hospital activities on the receiving environment. Furthermore, although the WWTP did not reduce the normalized integron copy number, it reduced the diversity of gene cassette arrays contained in the raw wastewater, underlining the effect of the biological treatment on the anthropogenic integron pool arriving at the WWTP. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Pharmaceutical manufacturers in Vietnam are producing a wide variety of antibiotics for human and veterinary use. Consequently, the water discharged from those facilities can contain residues of antibiotics, which could have adverse impact on the environment. However, studies on the occurrence of antibiotics in the wastewater from pharmaceutical manufacturers in Vietnam are almost non-existent. In this study, water samples were collected at around the outlets of four pharmaceutical manufacturing plants as well as from a hospital and an aquaculture farm around Hanoi in 2016 and 2017. Fifteen antibiotics from four major classes ($\beta$-lactam, quinolones, macrolides, sulfonamides) were monitored, using a validated LC-MS/MS method, based on their number of registrations at the Ministry of Health. Ten antibiotics, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, clarithromycin, azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were detected in the samples at different concentrations. Notably, sulfonamides and quinolones were occasionally detected at very high concentration, such as sulfamethoxazole (252 $\mu$g/L), trimethoprim (107 $\mu$g/L), ofloxacin (85 $\mu$g/L), and ciprofloxacin (41 $\mu$g/L). In this study, concentrations of antibiotic residues in effluent of pharmaceutical plants were higher than those from other sources. The antibiotic-resistance tests indicated the widespread resistance to common antibiotics like quinolone and sulfonamides in the collected samples. This finding suggests that wastewater from pharmaceutical manufacturers could be an important source of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the aquatic environment of Vietnam.},

Samples from hospital effluent, raw inflow and final effluent of the receiving wastewater treatment plant were characterized for amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance prevalence, content of heavy metals and antimicrobial residues and bacterial community structure, based on 16S rRNA gene PCR-DGGE analysis. The concentration of fluoroquinolones, arsenic and mercury was in general higher in hospital effluent than in raw inflow, while the opposite was observed for tetracyclines, sulfonamides and penicillin G. The prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance was significantly higher in hospital effluent than in raw inflow. The concentration of antimicrobial residues was observed to be significantly correlated with the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and with variations in the bacterial community. Hospital effluent was confirmed as a relevant, although not unique, source of antimicrobial residues and antibiotic resistant bacteria to the wastewater treatment plant. Moreover, given the high loads of antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistant bacteria that may occur in hospital effluents, these wastewater habitats may represent useful models to study and predict the impact of antibiotic residues on bacterial communities. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Transfer of antibiotic resistance between two different strains of bacteria was also studied. Untreated sewage from the three hospitals (Mayo, Services and Jinnah) directly entering into municipal wastewater and ultimately flows into the river Ravi without any prior treatment. The concentration of ofloxacin in wastewater of the three hospitals was ranged between 10.69 to 30.55 $\mu$g mL-1. However, before mixing of the hospital wastewater, concentration of ofloxacin in the three municipal wastewater drains (receiving the wastewater) was ranged between 0.26 to 0.43 $\mu$g mL-1. Downstream to the hospitals, increase in concentration was observed and concentration was ranged between 0.54 to 1.29 $\mu$g mL-1. The river water was not contaminated with ofloxacin upstream to the city, while a concentration of the antibiotic downstream to the city was 0.067 $\mu$g mL-1. All the water samples collected from hospital and municipal wastewater drains were contaminated with S. typhi. It was noted that hospital isolates were more resistant (50 %) to ofloxacin as compare to municipal wastewater isolates (16.7 %). No S. typhi was detected from the river water before entering first municipal wastewater drain from the city. Downstream to first municipal wastewater drain S. typhi were detected and 33 % of them were resistant to ofloxacin. The bacterial isolates isolated from river water downstream to the city were 100 % resistant to the antibiotic. The results of co-culture of ofloxacin resistant S. typhi and ofloxacin sensitive Escherichia coli revealed that the resistant S. typhi were able to transfer the antibiotic resistance to another species.},

To identify factors affecting the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, water samples were collected from three different STPs in South India. STP1 exclusively treats sewage generated by a domestic population. STP2 predominantly treats sewage generated by a domestic population with a mix of hospital effluent. STP3 treats effluents generated exclusively by a hospital. The water samples were collected between three intermediate treatment steps including equalization, aeration, and clarification, in addition to the outlet to assess the removal rates of bacteria as the effluent passed through the treatment plant. The samples were collected in three different seasons to study the effect of seasonal variation. Escherichia coli isolated from the water samples were tested for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials. The results of logistic regression analysis suggest that the hospital wastewater inflow significantly increased the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli, whereas the treatment processes and sampling seasons did not affect the prevalence of these isolates. A bias in the genotype distribution of E. coli was observed among the isolates obtained from STP3. In conclusion, hospital wastewaters should be carefully treated to prevent the contamination of Indian environment with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.},

abstract = {The environment harbours a significant diversity of uncultured bacteria and a potential source of novel and extant resistance genes which may recombine with clinically important bacteria disseminated into environmental reservoirs. There is evidence that pollution can select for resistance due to the aggregation of adaptive genes on mobile elements. The aim of this study was to establish the impact of waste water treatment plant (WWTP) effluent disposal to a river by using culture independent methods to study diversity of resistance genes downstream of the WWTP in comparison to upstream. Metagenomic libraries were constructed in Escherichia coli and screened for phenotypic resistance to amikacin, gentamicin, neomycin, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin. Resistance genes were identified by using transposon mutagenesis. A significant increase downstream of the WWTP was observed in the number of phenotypic resistant clones recovered in metagenomic libraries. Common $\beta$-lactamases such as blaTEM were recovered as well as a diverse range of acetyltransferases and unusual transporter genes, with evidence for newly emerging resistance mechanisms. The similarities of the predicted proteins to known sequences suggested origins of genes from a very diverse range of bacteria. The study suggests that waste water disposal increases the reservoir of resistance mechanisms in the environment either by addition of resistance genes or by input of agents selective for resistant phenotypes. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic inputs increase levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the environment, however, it is unknown how these inputs create this observed increase, and if anthropogenic sources impact AMR in environmental bacteria. The aim of this study was to characterise the role of waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) in the dissemination of class 1 integrons (CL1s) in the riverine environment. Using sample sites from upstream and downstream of a WWTP, we demonstrate through isolation and culture-independent analysis that WWTP effluent significantly increases both CL1 abundance and antibiotic resistance in the riverine environment. Characterisation of CL1-bearing isolates revealed that CL1s were distributed across a diverse range of bacteria, with identical complex genetic resistance determinants isolated from both human-associated and common environmental bacteria across connected sites. Over half of sequenced CL1s lacked the 3′-conserved sequence ('atypical' CL1s); surprisingly, bacteria carrying atypical CL1s were on average resistant to more antibiotics than bacteria carrying 3′-CS CL1s. Quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) resistance genes were observed across 75% of sequenced CL1 gene cassette arrays. Chemical data analysis indicated high levels of boron (a detergent marker) downstream of the WWTP. Subsequent phenotypic screening of CL1-bearing isolates demonstrated that $\sim$90% were resistant to QAC detergents, with in vitro experiments demonstrating that QACs could solely select for the transfer of clinical antibiotic resistance genes to a naive Escherichia coli recipient. In conclusion, this study highlights the significant impact of WWTPs on environmental AMR, and demonstrates the widespread carriage of clinically important resistance determinants by environmentally associated bacteria.},

The presence of 12 commonly used antibiotics in Ghana (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, trimethoprim, ampicillin, cefuroxime, sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline and doxycycline) were investigated in water and lettuce samples collected in three different areas in Kumasi, Ghana. The water samples were from hospital wastewater, wastewater stabilization ponds, rivers and irrigation water, while the lettuce samples were from vegetable farms and market vendors. Antibiotics in water samples were extracted using SPE while antibiotics in lettuce samples were extracted using accelerated solvent extraction followed by SPE. All extracted antibiotics samples were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. All studied compounds were detected in concentrations significantly higher (p = 0.01) in hospital wastewater than in the other water sources. The highest concentration found in the present study was 15 $\mu$g/L for ciprofloxacin in hospital wastewater. Irrigation water samples analyzed had concentrations of antibiotics up to 0.2 $\mu$g/L. Wastewater stabilization ponds are low technology but effective means of removing antibiotics with removal efficiency up to 95% recorded in this study. However, some chemicals are still found in levels indicating medium to high risk of antibiotics resistance development in the environment. The total concentrations of antibiotics detected in edible lettuce tissues from vegetable farms and vegetable sellers at the markets were in the range of 12.0–104 and 11.0–41.4 ng/kg (fresh weight) respectively. The antibiotics found with high concentrations in all the samples were sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim. Furthermore, our study confirms the presence of seven antibiotics in lettuce from irrigation farms and markets, suggesting an indirect exposure of humans to antibiotics through vegetable consumption and drinking water in Ghana. However, estimated daily intake for a standard 60 kg woman was 0.3 ng/day, indicating low risk for human health.},

The results revealed the existence of multiple AMRB grouped into six classes whose numbers were in the hospital effluent at 19 to 2,800 CFU/mL, in the STP influent at 9 to 3,133 CFU/mL, in the STP secondary effluent at 1 to 148 CFU/mL, in the STP effluent (chlorination) at N.D. to 191 CFU/mL, and in the river water at N.D. to 28 CFU/mL In the case of the STP effluent (ozonation) the level of AMRB was, however, quite low ranging from N.D. to several CFU/mL, roughly 1/10 to 1/100 of the concentrations detected in the STP effluent (chlorination). The bacterial community structure analysis indicates that only ozonation changed the constitution of bacterial phyla. Rates of antimicrobial resistance were high among MDRA (82% in hospital effluent and 79% in STP influent), MDRP (35% and 40%), and MRSA (93% and 87%). MRSA showed resistance against chlorine treatment but could be gradually disinfected by ozonation. When the hospital effluent and the model STP wastewater prepared by mixing STP influent and STP secondary effluent in a 1:9 ratio were directly treated with ozone, both AMRB and AMSB were inactivated effectively with variance in the time among bacteria, accompanied by a change in the constitution of phyla similar to the observation in the case of the STP effluent (ozonation). Ozonation inactivated almost all target bacteria (>99.9%) after 10 min treatment (CT value: 1.0 mg{\textperiodcentered}min/L). Changing taxonomic diversity of micro-organisms based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing by ozonation showed that ozonation inactivated not only AMRB but also removed antimicrobial resistance genes (AMRGs) in the wastewater. As a result of the present study, a recommendation was evoked to operate ozonation treatment directly for the hospital effluent immediately after flowing out, leading to desirable contribution to reduce environmental pollution, and the potential hazard to human health caused not only by the AMRB and AMSB but also infectious diseases. Extension of the present results opens a new way to assess environmental risks associated with the spread of AMRB and AMSB in aquatic environments to keep the water environment safe and to maintain human health. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show the inactivation profiles of AMRB and AMSB in real STP wastewater together with hospital effluent by direct ozonation.},

abstract = {All infections follow the basic epidemiological pattern that if recognized early helps to apply the measures to prevent and control pathologies. The epidemiological process cannot be triggered in the absence of the microorganism's reservoir and therefore it is very important to control the potential reservoirs involved in nosocomial infections. The etiological structure of nosocomial infections varies and includes a wide variety of potentially or strictly pathogenic bacteria that have native or acquired proprieties of virulence and antibiotic resistance. The aim of this project was to monitor the potential role of the environmental risk factors involved in outbreak nosocomial infections. The microbiological studies from an emergency hospital from Bucharest have been started in January 2016 and samples were quarterly collected from drilling and tap water, waste water, air and surfaces. There were performed quantitative analyzes of microbiological contamination level and qualitative analyzes for pathogenic and resistant bacteria detection. Some pathogenic bacteria have been identified in the waste water and drilling water, indicating their interference. The antibiotic resistance properties were observed especially in bacteria from waste waters. Bacteria from vegetables from food preparation were detected in air samples and surfaces tests from kitchen. The results indicated that environmental factors from a medical unit could constitute a reservoir of microorganisms that can trigger nosocomial infections.},

abstract = {Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent has been implicated in the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), including pathogens, as the WWTP environment contains multiple selective pressures that may increase mutation rates, pathogen survivability, and induce gene transfer between bacteria. In WWTPs receiving hospital sewage, this selective effect may be more pronounced due to increased concentrations of antibiotics, ARB, and clinical pathogens from hospital sewage. To determine the extent to which hospital sewage contributes to the microbial community of disinfected wastewater which is released into the environment, we used 16S rRNA sequencing of hospital sewage, WWTP influent, primary effluent, Post-Chlorinated Effluent, and receiving sediments in a combined sewage system to track changes in microbial community composition. We also sequenced the culturable survivor community resistant to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics within disinfected effluent. Using molecular source tracking, we found that the hospital sewage microbiome contributes an average of 11.49% of the microbial community in Post-Chlorinated Effluents, suggesting microorganisms identified within hospital sewage can survive or are enriched by the chlorination disinfection process. Additionally, we identified 28 potential pathogens to the species level, seven of which remained detectable in Post-Chlorinated Effluent and environmental sediments. When Post-Chlorinated Effluents were cultured on media containing $\beta$-lactam antibiotics ceftazidime and meropenem, a diverse antibiotic resistant survivor community was identified including potential human pathogens Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, and Chryseobacterium indologenes. Together, these results indicate that although wastewater treatment does significantly reduce pathogenic loads and ARBs, their continual presence in disinfected wastewater and receiving sediments suggests additional treatment and microbial tracking systems are needed to reduce human and animal health risks.},

abstract = {Beef and pig carcases, meat products, frozen chickens, and sewage were examined in 3 separate surveys for antibiotic resistant coliforms. Escherichia coli was isolated from 18 of 50 beef carcases; the numbers were low and resistance was found only to tetracycline. E. coli was isolated from 45 of 50 pig carcases; the numbers were high and showed a range of patterns of multiple antibiotic resistance. In meat products, the proportion of E. coli in contaminating organisms was low, and most resistance found was to tetracycline and streptomycin. E. coli was isolated from 66 of 75 chickens and these gave 23 patterns of antibiotic resistance, often multiple. Sewage from hospital or domestic origin and abattoir effluent yielded approximately 106 coliforms/ml, most of which were resistant to one or more antibiotics; few of those from hospital or domestic origin however, were classified as E. coli of faecal origin. Twenty‐four patterns of resistance were found in coliforms from domestic sewage, 19 from hospital sewage and 11 from abattoir effluent. Transfer of resistance, often multiple, was achieved from 55% of 447 resistant strains to an E. coli K12 recipient. Much more information is required on the prevalence of R‐factors in bacteria associated with food producing animals and their products. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1981, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract = {Aims: Scarce knowledge about the distribution of enterococci species in wastewaters limits any statement on their reliability as faecal indicators or the implications of antibiotic resistance transmission by these organisms through the water cycle. Enterococci have been involved in nosocomial infections and the spreading of antibiotic resistance through the food chain. The species distribution of enterococci and the presence of resistant strains to vancomycin and erythromycin were analysed in more than 400 raw and treated urban wastewaters, surface waters receiving these treated wastewaters and hospital wastewaters from three European countries. Methods and Results: A total of 9296 strains were isolated and biochemically phenotyped. The species identification was based on the comparison of biochemical profiles with those of more than 20 000 enterococci isolates from an international study. The prevalence of enterococcal isolates resistant to erythromycin (ERE) and vancomycin (VRE) was also analysed. ERE strains were present in a high proportion in all the studied samples. VRE strains were also isolated in all studied countries despite the time elapsed since the use of antimicrobial glycopeptides in animal production was banned in the European Union. Conclusions: Enterococcus faecalis and Ent. faecium were the most abundant species in all the studied wastewaters. All the studied wastewaters demonstrated high diversity and similar population structure and composition. ERE and VRE isolates were detected in most of the wastewaters. Significance and Impact of the Study: Urban and hospital wastewaters are useful targets for the evaluation of the prevalence of ERE and VRE isolates in the environment. It appears that these bacteria could pass through wastewater treatment plants and be transferred to surface waters.},

We previously demonstrated the presence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in sachet-packaged water bags sold in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In complement to the previous study, we aimed to assess the presence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in waste waters in Kinshasa.Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from environmental water samples were screened and phenotypically confirmed as ESBL-producers by disk diffusion according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (CLSI M100-S21). Final identification to the species level and further antimicrobial susceptibility testing were carried out with MicroScan{\textregistered} NBC42 panels and the identification of bla ESBL coding genes was performed by a commercial multiplex ligation polymerase chain reaction (PCR) microarray (Check-Points CT 101, Wageningen, the Netherlands). Overall, 194 non-duplicate Enterobacteriaceae were recovered from several sewer and river sites in nine out of 24 municipalities of Kinshasa. Fourteen isolates (7.4 %) were confirmed as ESBL-producers, the main species being Enterobacter cloacae (46.6 %) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (40.0 %). Associated resistance to both aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone antibiotics was observed in ten isolates; the remaining isolates showed co-resistance to either fluoroquinolone (n=3) or to aminoglycoside (n=1) alone. All but one isolate carried bla CTX-M genes belonging to the CTX-M-1 group. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are increasingly being reported from various sources in the community. The present results suggest that ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are widespread in the environment in the community of Kinshasa. Cities in Central Africa should be added to the map of potentially ESBL-contaminated environments and highlight the need to reinforce safe water supply and public sanitation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {A study was conducted to investigate the impact of raw wastewater use for irrigation on dissemination of bacterial resistance in urban agriculture in African cities. The pollution of agricultural fields by selected antibiotic residues was assessed. The structure and functions of the soil microbial communities, presence of antibiotic resistance genes of human clinical importance and Enterobacteriaceae plasmid replicons were analysed using high throughput metagenomic sequencing. In irrigated fields, the richness of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla increased by 65% and 15.7%, respectively; functions allocated to microbial communities' adaptation and development increased by 3%. Abundance of antibiotic resistance genes of medical interest was 27% greater in irrigated fields. Extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamase genes identified in irrigated fields included blaCARB-3, blaOXA-347, blaOXA-5 and blaRm3. The presence of ARGs encoding resistance to amphenicols, $\beta$-lactams, and tetracyclines were associated with the higher concentrations of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole in irrigated fields. Ten Enterobacteriaceae plasmid amplicon groups involved in the wide distribution of ARGs were identified in the fields. IncQ2, ColE, IncFIC, IncQ1, and IncFII were found in both farming systems; IncW and IncP1 in irrigated fields; and IncY, IncFIB and IncFIA in non-irrigated fields. In conclusion, raw wastewater irrigated soils in African cities could represent a vector for the spread of antibiotic resistance, thus threatening human and animal health. Consumers of products from these farms and farmers could be at risk of acquiring infections due to drug-resistant bacteria.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is considered an opportunistic pathogen, causing a wide variety of infections in compromised hosts, also frequently develops multi-resistance to antibiotics and can colonize various habitats, including water systems. The main aim of this study was to investigate antibiotics susceptibility pattern, genotypic diversity and detection of resistence genes in P. aeruginosa isolates from clinical and aquatic environment sources. Of the 220 P. aeruginosa isolates examined, 48 were clinical isolates and 172 isolates from wastewater and freshwater. Susceptibility to eight antimicrobial agents was carried out by disk diffusion method. Clinical and environmental isolates were screened for the presence of the genes encoding blaKPC-2, blaCTX-M-9, blaPER-1, blaOXA-10, blaIMP-1, blaVIM-2 and blaampC by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Isolates were examined with PCR-SSCP analysis of partial DNAr 16S sequence. Isolates were mainly resistant to cefoxitin. Multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRPA) strains were found in 70% and 90.3% of the clinical and environmental isolates, respectively. The prevalence rates of {\^{a}}-lactamase genes were recorded (blaKPC-2 41.3%, blaVIM-2 36.8%, blaIMP-1 13.6%, blaCTX-M-9 10.9% and blaampC 10.5%,). The PCR-SSCP analysis showed three conformational patterns. All clinical isolates and most environmental isolates were grouped into a single cluster. In this study, we found that P. aeruginosa strains recovered from city water systems must be considered potential reservoir for ESBL genes, especially blaKPC-2 and blaVIM-2.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is an increasing global problem resulting from the pressure of antibiotic usage, greater mobility of the population, and industrialization. Many antibiotic resistance genes are believed to have originated in microorganisms in the environment, and to have been transferred to other bacteria through mobile genetic elements. Among others, $\beta$-lactam antibiotics show clinical efficacy and low toxicity, and they are thus widely used as antimicrobials. Resistance to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics is conferred by $\beta$-lactamase genes and penicillin-binding proteins, which are chromosomal- or plasmid-encoded, although there is little information available on the contribution of other mobile genetic elements, such as phages. This study is focused on three genes that confer resistance to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics, namely two $\beta$-lactamase genes (blaTEM and blaCTX-M9) and one encoding a penicillin-binding protein (mecA) in bacteriophage DNA isolated from environmental water samples. The three genes were quantified in the DNA isolated from bacteriophages collected from 30 urban sewage and river water samples, using quantitative PCR amplification. All three genes were detected in the DNA of phages from all the samples tested, in some cases reaching 104 gene copies (GC) of blaTEM or 102 GC of blaCTX-M and mecA. These values are consistent with the amount of fecal pollution in the sample, except for mecA, which showed a higher number of copies in river water samples than in urban sewage. The bla genes from phage DNA were transferred by electroporation to sensitive host bacteria, which became resistant to ampicillin. blaTEM and blaCTX were detected in the DNA of the resistant clones after transfection. This study indicates that phages are reservoirs of resistance genes in the environment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Colomer-Lluch et al.},

abstract = {Objectives: The present study was carried out to evaluate the prevalence of clonal group O25b:H4-B2-ST131 in water environments with faecal pollution (urban sewage and river water) in the north-east of Spain and to study the virulence gene content of environmental isolates and to compare them with isolates causing human extraintestinal infections in Spain. Methods: This study was performed with 10 sewage samples (collected in Catalonia, north-eastern Spain, in autumn 2009 from the influent raw urban sewage of a wastewater treatment plant that serves a large urban area) and 6 river water samples (collected monthly from February to April 2010 in the Llobregat river catchment area, near Barcelona, a watercourse subjected to heavy anthropogenic pressure). Escherichia coli colonies were screened by PCR for the rfbO25b gene associated with the clonal group O25b:H4-B2-ST131. Sequence types (STs), serotypes, virulence genes, PFGE profiles, antimicrobial resistance and extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes were determined in 75 E. coli isolates positive for the O25b molecular subtype. Results: Of the 75 O25b-positive isolates, 51 belonged to the O25b:H4-B2-ST131 clonal group and the remaining 24 belonged to clonal group O25b:H4-D-ST69. The majority of ST69 isolates (23 of 24) were isolated from urban sewage, whereas ST131 isolates were isolated from urban sewage (25 isolates) as well as from river water (26 isolates). ST131 and ST69 isolates carried 4-13 virulence genes, the majority (82%) being quinolone resistant. Conclusions: We showed the presence of E. coli isolates belonging to clonal groups O25b:H4-B2-ST131 and O25b:H4-D-ST69 in raw sewage and river water in Barcelona. Furthermore, we observed that the environmental O25b:H4-B2-ST131 isolates showed similar virulence and macrorestriction profiles to clinical human isolates.

abstract = {At present, very little is known about the fate and persistence of multiresistant bacteria (MRB) and their resistance genes in natural aquatic environments. Treated, but partly also untreated sewage of the city of Lausanne, Switzerland is discharged into Vidy Bay (Lake Geneva) resulting in high levels of contamination in this part of the lake. In the present work we have studied the prevalence of MRB and resistance genes in the wastewater stream of Lausanne. Samples from hospital and municipal raw sewage, treated effluent from Lausanne's wastewater treatment plant (WTP) as well as lake water and sediment samples obtained close to the WTP outlet pipe and a remote site close to a drinking water pump were evaluated for the prevalence of MRB. Selected isolates were identified (16S rRNA gene fragment sequencing) and characterized with regards to further resistances, resistance genes, and plasmids. Mostly, studies investigating this issue have relied on cultivation-based approaches. However, the limitations of these tools are well known, in particular for environmental microbial communities, and cultivation-independent molecular tools should be applied in parallel in order to take non-culturable organisms into account. Here we directly quantified the sulfonamide resistance genes sull and sul2 from environmental DNA extracts using TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR. Hospital sewage contained the highest load of MRB and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Wastewater treatment reduced the total bacterial load up to 78% but evidence for selection of extremely multiresistant strains and accumulation of resistance genes was observed. Our data clearly indicated pollution of sediments with ARGs in the vicinity of the WTP outlet. The potential of lakes as reservoirs of MRB and potential risks are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Czekalski, Berthold, Caucci, Egliand B{\"{u}}rgmann.},

abstract = {Enterococci are important nosocomial pathogens, with Enterococcus faecalis most commonly responsible for human infections. In this study, we used several measures to test the hypothesis that house flies, Musca domestica (L.), acquire and disseminate antibiotic-resistant and potentially virulent E. faecalis from wastewater treatment facilities (WWTF) to the surrounding urban environment. House flies and sludge from four WWTF (1-4) as well as house flies from three urban sites close to WWTF-1 were collected and cultured for enterococci. Enterococci were identified, quantified, screened for antibiotic resistance and virulence traits, and assessed for clonality. Of the 11 antibiotics tested, E. faecalis was most commonly resistant to tetracycline, doxycycline, streptomycin, gentamicin, and erythromycin, and these traits were intra-species horizontally transferrable by in vitro conjugation. Profiles of E. faecalis (prevalence, antibiotic resistance, and virulence traits) from each of WWTF sludge and associated house flies were similar, indicating that flies successfully acquired these bacteria from this substrate. The greatest number of E. faecalis with antibiotic resistance and virulence factors (i.e., gelatinase, cytolysin, enterococcus surface protein, and aggregation substance) originated from WWTF-1 that processed meat waste from a nearby commercial meat-processing plant, suggesting an agricultural rather than human clinical source of these isolates. E. faecalis from house flies collected from three sites 0.7-1.5 km away from WWTF-1 were also similar in their antibiotic resistance profiles; however, antibiotic resistance was significantly less frequent. Clonal diversity assessment using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the same clones of E. faecalis from sludge and house flies from WWTF-1 but not from the three urban sites close to WWTF-1. This study demonstrates that house flies acquire antibiotic-resistant enterococci from WWTF and potentially disseminate them to the surrounding environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The present study evaluated the contribution of untreated hospital wastewater to the dissemination of resistant P. aeruginosa strains in aquatic environments, through the analysis of their antibiotic susceptibility profile and genetic similarity. Wastewater samples were collected from two hospitals located in Rio Grande do Sul, RS, Brazil. Superficial water samples were collected from water bodies that received this wastewater discharge. The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the strains were determined using the disk-diffusion technique and their genotyping was done by amplification of the Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus sequences (ERIC-PCR). The antibiotic resistance was higher among the hospital wastewater strains and the multiresistant phenotype was also observed only among these strains. The ERIC-PCR profiles did not reveal any genetic similarity among the P. aeruginosa strains from the wastewater and superficial water samples. On the contrary, they showed that genetically distinct populations were established in these different environments and probably that some other contamination source could be contributing to the presence of resistant strains in these water bodies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The variability of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (CRPA) isolated from urine and respiratory samples in a large microbiological laboratory, serving several health care settings, and from effluents of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) from the same region was assessed by PFGE typing and by resistance to 10 antibiotics. During the 12-month period altogether 213 carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates were cultured and distributed into 65 pulsotypes and ten resistance profiles. For representatives of all 65 pulsotypes 49 different MLSTs were determined. Variability of clinical and environmental strains was comparable, 130 carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa obtained from 109 patients were distributed into 38 pulsotypes, while 83 isolates from WWTPs were classified into 31 pulsotypes. Only 9 pulsotypes were shared between two or more settings (hospital or WWTP). Ten MLST were determined for those prevalent pulsotypes, two of them (ST111 and ST235) are among most successful CRPA types worldwide. Clinical and environmental carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains differed in antibiotic resistance. The highest proportion of clinical isolates was resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam (52.3%) and ceftazidime (42.3%). The highest proportion of environmental isolates was resistant to ceftazidime (37.1%) and ciprofloxacin (35.5%). The majority of isolates was resistant only to imipenem and/or meropenem. Strains with additional resistances were distributed into nine different patterns. All of them included clinically relevant strains, while environmental strains showed only four additional different patterns.},

abstract = {Extracts of wastewater collected from 4 sewage treatment plants (STPs) receiving effluents from different sources in South India were investigated for their levels of transcription factormediated gene induction in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. In addition, the relation between gene induction levels and the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) in wastewater was examined. STP-3, which treats only hospital wastewater, exhibited significantly greater induction potency of all 6 drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes examined, CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2B15, 3A1, and 3A2, whereas the wastewater at STP-1, which exclusively receives domestic sewage, showed significantly diminished levels of induction of 3 CYP genes when compared to the levels of CYP induction at STP-2, which receives mixed wastewater. Samples collected during the monsoon season showed a significantly altered gene induction capacity compared to that of samples from the premonsoon period. The data suggest that the toxicity of wastewater in STPs was not significantly diminished during the treatment process. The chemical-gene interaction data predicted that a vast number of chemicals present in the wastewater would stimulate the genes studied in the rat hepatocytes. The multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the prevalence of isolates resistant to cefotaxime, imipenem and streptomycin was significantly correlated with the levels of induction of at least three CYP-isozymes in STP wastewater. In addition, the resistance of isolates in treatment plants was not altered by the treatment steps, whereas the sampling season did have an impact on the resistance to specific antimicrobials. The identification of receptor-mediated gene regulation capacities offers important data not limited to the (synergistic) physiological role of chemicals in biological systems but may provide new insight into the link between the effects of known/unknown drugs and prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in wastewater.},

abstract = {There is a concern that hospital effluent potentially containing antimicrobial compounds, antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria and genetic determinants of resistance may contribute to the emergence, dissemination and persistence of AMR bacteria in municipal wastewaters. Hence, it is of interest to investigate the effect, if any, hospital effluent has on the percentage of AMR bacteria within wastewater. Water from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (one receives and treats hospital effluent (WWTP<inf>he</inf>) and the second does not (WWTP<inf>c</inf>)) were examined for E. coli expressing resistance to seven antimicrobials (ampicillin, streptomycin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, tetracycline, sulphonamide and ciprofloxacin). A two-sample t-test showed that AMR E. coli are present in WWTP influent and effluent, irrespective of receiving hospital effluent, and are being released into the environment (no statistical difference in count between the two WWTPs). The effect of hospital effluent on resistance varies for each AMR bacteria. Excluding tetracycline, sulphonamide and ciprofloxacin, the results suggest that the release of hospital effluent does not significantly affect the frequency with which AMR E. coli are detected in effluent. For some hospital specific antimicrobial agents, such as ciprofloxacin, the release of hospital effluent is associated with an increased proportion of antimicrobial resistance. The results suggest resistance to AMR E. coli may already be well developed in the community, making the effect of hospital effluent on AMR E. coli indistinguishable. However, for hospital specific antimicrobials, there may be a selective effect and hence limiting the release of hospital effluent containing such antimicrobials may impact the proportion of antimicrobial resistance. This research has provided statistical evidence to support necessary mitigation and remediation of antimicrobial residue release and subsequent resistance in the environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {Background Worldwide, the number of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is increasing, highlighting the importance of global disease pathogen surveillance. Traditional population-based methods may fail to capture important events, particularly in settings with limited access to health care, such as urban informal settlements. In such environments, a mixture of surface water runoff and human feces containing pathogenic microorganisms could be used as a surveillance surrogate. Method We conducted a temporal metagenomic analysis of urban sewage from Kibera, an urban informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, to detect and quantify bacterial and associated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants, viral and parasitic pathogens. Data were examined in conjunction with data from ongoing clinical infectious disease surveillance. Results A large variation of read abundances related to bacteria, viruses, and parasites of medical importance, as well as bacterial associated antimicrobial resistance genes over time were detected. Significant increased abundances were observed for a number of bacterial pathogens coinciding with higher abundances of AMR genes. Vibrio cholerae as well as rotavirus A, among other virus peaked in several weeks during the study period whereas Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp, varied more over time. Conclusion The metagenomic surveillance approach for monitoring circulating pathogens in sewage was able to detect putative pathogen and resistance loads in an urban informal settlement. Thus, valuable if generated in real time to serve as a comprehensive infectious disease agent surveillance system with the potential to guide disease prevention and treatment. The approach may lead to a paradigm shift in conducting real-time global genomics-based surveillance in settings with limited access to health care.},

abstract = {A comprehensive multiphasic survey of the prevalence and transfer of gentamicin resistance (Gmr) genes in different non-clinical environments has been performed. We were interested to find out whether Gmr genes described from clinical isolates can be detected in different environmental habitats and whether hot spots can be identified. Furthermore, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of selective pressure on the abundance and mobility of resistance genes. The study included samples from soils, rhizospheres, piggery manure, faeces from cattle, laying and broiler chickens, municipal and hospital sewage water, and coastal water. Six clusters of genes coding for Gm-modifying enzymes (aac(3)-I, aac(3)-II/VI, aac(3)-III/IV, aac(6′)-II/Ib, ant(2″)-I, aph(2″)-I) were identified based on a database comparison and primer systems for each gene cluster were developed. Gm-resistant bacteria isolated from the different environments had a different taxonomic composition. In only 34 of 207 isolates, mainly originating from sewage, faeces and coastal water polluted with wastewater, were known Gmr genes corresponding to five of the six clusters detected. The strains belonged to genera in which the genes had previously been detected (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter) but also to phylogenetically distant bacteria, such as members of the CFB group, $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Proteobacteria. Gmr genes located on mobile genetic elements (MGE) could be captured in exogenous isolations into recipients belonging to $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and $\gamma$-Proteobacteria from all environments except for soil. A high proportion of the MGE, conferring Gm resistance isolated from sewage, were identified as IncP$\beta$ plasmids. Molecular detection of Gmr genes, and broad host range plasmid-specific sequences (IncP-1, IncN, IncW and IncQ) in environmental DNA indicated a habitat-specific dissemination. A high abundance and diversity of Gmr genes could be shown for samples from faeces (broilers, layers, cattle), from sewage, from seawater, collected close to a wastewater outflow, and from piggery manure. In the latter samples all six clusters of Gmr genes could be detected. The different kinds of selective pressure studied here seemed to enhance the abundance of MGE, while an effect on Gmr genes was not obvious. {\textcopyright} 2002 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between antimicrobial tolerance and taxonomic diversity among the culturable oxytetracycline-resistant (Otr) heterotrophic bacterial population in two Belgian aquatic sites receiving wastewater either from human medicine or from aquaculture. The study of Otr heterotrophs and mesophilic Aeromonas spp. allowed comparison of tolerance data at the intergenus as well as at the intragenus level. In total, 354 independently obtained Otr isolates were subjected to antimicrobial tolerance testing and identified by GLC analysis of their cellular fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), by API 20E profiling and/or by Fluorescent Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (FAFLP) DNA fingerprinting. In general, Otr hospital heterotrophs displayed a higher frequency (84%) of ampicillin (Amp) tolerance compared to the Otr heterotrophs from the freshwater fishfarm site (22%). FAME results indicated that this effect was linked to the predominance of intrinsically ampicillin-resistant Otr Aeromonas strains over representatives of Acinetobacter and Escherichia coli within the hospital strain set. Among the Otr mesophilic Aeromonas strain set, the global tolerance profiles of the two sites only differed in a higher number of kanamycin (Kan) -tolerant strains (43%) for hospital aeromonads in comparison with the fishfarm aeromonads (8%). To some extent, this finding was correlated with the specific presence of Aeromonas caviae DNA hybridisation group (HG) 4. Collectively, these results suggest that the profiles for Amp and Kan tolerance observed in both sites arose from taxonomic differences in the culturable Otr bacterial population at the generic or subgeneric level. In addition, our identification data also revealed that Enterobacter sp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and A. veronii biovar sobria HG8 may be considered potential indicator organisms to assess microbial tolerance in various compartments of the aquatic environment.},

abstract = {An ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterococcus faeclum (ARE) strain, named FMSE1, with a characteristic biochemical phenotype, was in a recent study found to dominate among faecal ARE isolates from patients in several Swedish hospitals. In the present study, the prevalence of this strain among 9676 enterococcal isolates from healthy children, hospital sewage, urban sewage, surface water, slaughtered animals (broilers, pigs and cattle) and pig faeces and manure was investigated. Enterococcal isolates having the same biochemical phenotype as the FMSE1 were most common in samples of hospital sewage (50%), surface water (35%), treated sewage (28%) and untreated sewage (17%), but rare in samples from healthy children (0.8%) and animals (2%). PFGE typing of FMSE1-like isolates from hospital sewage indicated that they were closely related to the nosocomial FMSE1 strain. Thus, this study indicated a possible transmission route for nosocomial E. faecium from patients in hospitals to hospital sewage and urban sewage, and further via treatment plants to surface water and possibly back to humans. This proposed route of circulation of drug-resistant enterococci might be further amplified by antibiotic usage in human medicine. In contrast, such transmission from food animals seems to play a negligible role in Sweden.},

The data collected from this study would allow us to control the spread and develop strategies for treatment of the enterococcal infections. Materials and Methods: In this study, 156 vancomycin-sensitive E. faecium (VSEF; 58) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREF; 98) samples were isolated from clinical specimen and sewage treatment plants (STPs). These isolates were screened for the presence of genes encoding for aggregation substance (asa1), cytolysin (cyl), enterococcal surface protein (esp), gelatinase (gelE) and hyaluronidase (hyl) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Although significantly different, the results showed the presence of hyl and esp genes in both clinical (41 and 75%, respectively) and sewage (3.2 and 41%, respectively) isolates. Sensitivity of all isolates to seven antibiotics was examined. The results of the clinical isolates showed that the majority of esp positive isolates were also resistant to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and erythromycin. Furthermore, cyl, gelE and asa1 were not found in either clinical or STP isolates. Finally, we determined the distinct types of isolates using Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), which confirmed that most of the isolates were clonally unrelated. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that higher number of the clinical E. faecium isolates carried virulence genes than the isolates from STP. Finally, the lack of the genes in clinical and STP isolates confirmed that these genes do not transfer horizontally.},

abstract = {The effluents from wastewater treatment plants have been recognized as a significant environmental reservoir of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Reclaimed water irrigation (RWI) is increasingly used as a practical solution for combating water scarcity in arid and semiarid regions, however, impacts of RWI on the patterns of ARGs and the soil bacterial community remain unclear. Here, we used high-throughput quantitative PCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques to compare the diversity, abundance and composition of a broad-spectrum of ARGs and total bacteria in 12 urban parks with and without RWI in Victoria, Australia. A total of 40 unique ARGs were detected across all park soils, with genes conferring resistance to $\beta$-lactam being the most prevalent ARG type. The total numbers and the fold changes of the detected ARGs were significantly increased by RWI, and marked shifts in ARG patterns were also observed in urban parks with RWI compared to those without RWI. The changes in ARG patterns were paralleled by a significant effect of RWI on the bacterial community structure and a co-occurrence pattern of the detected ARG types. There were significant and positive correlations between the fold changes of the integrase intI1 gene and two $\beta$-lactam resistance genes (KPC and IMP-2 groups), but no significant impacts of RWI on the abundances of intI1 and the transposase tnpA gene were found, indicating that RWI did not improve the potential for horizontal gene transfer of soil ARGs. Taken together, our findings suggested that irrigation of urban parks with reclaimed water could influence the abundance, diversity, and compositions of a wide variety of soil ARGs of clinical relevance. One-sentence summary Irrigation of urban parks with treated wastewater significantly increased the abundance and diversity of various antibiotic resistance genes, but did not significantly enhance their potential for horizontal gene transfer.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are considered environmental pollutants. Comprehensive characterization of the ARGs in pristine environments is essential towards understanding the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Here, we analyzed ARGs in soil samples collected from relatively pristine Antarctica using metagenomic approaches. We identified 79 subtypes related to 12 antibiotic classes in Antarctic soils, in which ARGs related to multidrug and polypeptide were dominant. The characteristics of ARGs in Antarctic soils were significantly different from those in active sludge, chicken feces and swine feces, in terms of composition, abundance and potential transferability. ARG subtypes (e.g., bacA, ceoB, dfrE, mdtB, amrB, and acrB) were more abundant than others in Antarctic soils. Approximately 60% of the ARGs conferred antibiotic resistance via an efflux mechanism, and a low fraction of ARGs (∼16%) might be present on plasmids. Culturable bacterial consortiums isolated from Antarctic soils were consistently susceptible to most of the tested antibiotics frequently used in clinical therapies. The amrB and ceoB carried by culturable species did not express the resistance to aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone at the levels of clinical concern. Our results suggest that the wide use of antibiotics may have contributed to developing higher antibiotic resistance and mobility.},

abstract = {Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family are a significant threat to public health, posing a challenge for health authorities worldwide. In the UAE, very little information is available about ESBL producing bacteria from non-clinical sources. In this study, 206 pure cultures belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were isolated from food and wastewater sources in Dubai, UAE. All the isolates were tested against third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics by the disc diffusion method and screened on ESBL chromogenic agar. Among all isolates (n = 86), 41.7% were potential ESBL producers belonging to E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Shigella, and Citrobacter (KESC group), and Proteus. Of all the potential ESBL producing isolates, 19 (22%) were confirmed as ESBL producers by a double-disc diffusion test with the fourth generation cephalosporin-Cefpirome. The multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection of ESBL bla genes in the screened isolates. Out of a total of 86 isolates, 52.3% possessed only the blaTEM gene, 39.5% contained both blaTEM and blaSHV genes, while only 3.5% contained the blaCTX-M gene. The carbapenemase resistance test showed eight isolates resistant to imipenem, and only one isolate with metallo-beta-lactamase activity. This study highlights the occurrence of ESBL bla genes among non-clinical isolates from food and wastewater sources in the UAE and emphasizes the importance of food and wastewater surveillance programs in controlling the spread of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {The resence and persistence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the environment is thought to be a growing threat to public health. The route of the spread of multiresistant bacteria from human communities to aquatic environment may lead through wastewater treatment plants that release treated wastewater to a water reservoir. In this study we used multiplex PCR assay to determine the frequency of integron presence in Escherichia coli isolates cultured from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) (integrons were detected in 11% of E. coli isolates), river water upstream (6%) and downstream (14%) the discharge of WWTP, and clinical specimens (56%). Antimicrobial resistance of the integron-positive isolates, determined by disk diffusion method, varied between E. coli of different origin. Isolates from the downstream river, compared to those cultured from upstream river, were more frequently resistant to kanamycin, cephalotin, co-trimoxazole, trimethoprim, and fluoroquinolones. Moreover, they displayed broader resistance ranges, expressed as the number of classes of antimicrobials to which they were resistant. The results may suggest that WWTP effluent contributes to increased frequency of integron-positive E. coli isolates in the river downstream the WWTP and to their elevated resistance level. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Data concerning the occurrence of emerging biological contaminants such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in aquatic environments in Sub-Saharan African countries is limited. On the other hand, antibiotic resistance remains a worldwide problem which may pose serious potential risks to human and animal health. Consequently, there is a growing number of reports concerning the prevalence and dissemination of these contaminants into various environmental compartments. Sediments provide the opportunity to reconstruct the pollution history and evaluate impacts so this study investigates the abundance and distribution of toxic metals, FIB, and ARGs released from hospital effluent wastewaters and their presence in river sediments receiving systems. ARGs (blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaSHV, and aadA), total bacterial load, and selected bacterial species FIB [Escherichia coli, Enterococcus (ENT)] and species (Psd) were quantified by targeting species specific genes using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in total DNA extracted from the sediments recovered from 4 hospital outlet pipes (HOP) and their river receiving systems in the City of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The results highlight the great concentration of toxic metals in HOP, reaching the values (in mg kg-1) of 47.9 (Cr), 213.6 (Cu), 1434.4 (Zn), 2.6 (Cd), 281.5 (Pb), and 13.6 (Hg). The results also highlight the highest (P <0.05) values of 16S rRNA, FIB, and ARGs copy numbers in all sampling sites including upstream (control site), discharge point, and downstream of receiving rivers, indicating that the hospital effluent water is not an exclusive source of the biological contaminants entering the urban rivers. Significant correlation were observed between (i) all analyzed ARGs and total bacterial load (16S rRNA) 0.51 to 0.72 (p < 0.001, n = 65); (ii) ARGs (except blaTEM) and FIB and Psd 0.57 < r < 0.82 (p < 0.001, n = 65); and (iii) ARGs (except blaTEM) and toxic metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, and Zn) 0.44 to 0.72, (p < 0.001, n = 65). These findings demonstrate that several sources including hospital and urban wastewaters contribute to the spread of toxic metals and biological emerging contaminants in aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Increasing antibiotic resistant hospital-acquired infections and limited new antibiotic discovery are jeopardizing human health at global scales, although how hospitals themselves fuel antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the wider environment is largely unknown. Antibiotic resistance (AR) in hospitals in countries such as India is potentially problematic because of high antibiotic use, overcrowding, and inadequate wastewater containment. Here we quantified fecal coliforms (FC), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), blaNDM-1, and selected extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactam (ESBL) resistant bacteria and genes in 12 hospital wastewater outfalls and five background sewer drains across New Delhi over two seasons. Hospital wastewaters had up to 9 orders of magnitude greater concentrations of CRE bacteria and blaNDM-1 than local sewers (depending on the hospital), implying hospitals contribute high concentrations of AR relative to community sources in Delhi, especially during the winter. Significant correlations were found between FC levels (a fecal indictor), and CRE (r = 0.924; p = 0.005), blaNDM-1 (r = 0.934, p = 0.009), and ESBL-resistant bacteria (r = 0.913, p = 0.010) levels across hospital wastewaters, respectively, implying that elevated CRE and blaNDM-1 are of patient origin. However, of greater importance to global health, microbial culturing found 18 to 41% of wastewater CRE isolates (n = 1447) were on the WHO "critical pathogen" list in urgent need of new antibiotics, and 55% of CRE isolates from larger hospitals carried at least one blaNDM-1 gene. Wastewater releases from New Delhi hospitals may pose a greater AR exposure risk to residents than believed, implying in-hospital antibiotic use must be better controlled and more effective waste treatment is needed for hospital wastewaters.},

abstract = {Enterococci are gastrointestinal tract residents and also an important cause of nosocomial infections. To understand which species, virulence determinants, and antibiotic resistances are prevalent in enterococci shed by various hosts groups, a total of 1460 strains isolated from 144 fecal samples obtained from wastewater, domesticated mammals and birds, and wildlife were characterized. Identification of isolates to the species level showed that Enterococcus faecalis was dominant in domesticated mammals and birds and wildlife feces, whereas Enterococcus faecium was dominant among wastewater isolates, and that no single Enterococcus species could be associated with a specific host group. The frequency of 12 virulence determinants was evaluated among isolates, but no single virulence determinant could be associated with a specific host group. Resistance to 12 antibiotics was evaluated among isolates, and it was shown that the highest frequency of resistance at breakpoint concentration was found in domesticated mammals and birds (P ≤ 0.05 for 4 antibiotics). Our results suggests that (1) species identification and virulence typing of Enterococcus spp. isolates are not useful for the identification of the host groups responsible for fecal contamination of water by microbial source tracking and that (2) antibiotic use for clinical, veterinary, or animal husbandry practices is promoting resistance.},

The main results of this study are (i) the ecotoxicity and antibiotic resistance potentials of hospital wastewater are higher than in urban wastewater and (ii) mixing two different effluents does not lead to global synergistic or antagonistic effects on ecotoxicity and antibiotic resistance potential. The global additivity effect observed in this case must be confirmed by other studies on hospital and urban effluents on other sites to improve knowledge relating to this source of pollution and its management.},

abstract = {The antibiotic-resistance characteristics of bacterial strains in antibiotic production wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) that contain high concentrations of antibiotics are unknown, as are the environmental effects of the discharge of wastewater from such facilities. In this study, 417 strains were individually isolated from the effluent of a WWTP that treated penicillin G production wastewater, as well as from downstream and upstream areas of the receiving river. The minimum inhibition concentrations (MICs) of 18 antibiotics representing seven classes were then determined for each of these strains. Relatively high similarity in the bacterial composition existed between the wastewater and downstream river samples when compared with the upstream sample. High resistance ratios and MIC values were observed for almost all antibiotics in wastewater isolates, followed by strains from downstream river, of which the resistance ratios and levels were still significantly higher than those of upstream strains. The resistance ratios and levels also significantly differed among strains belonged to different species in the penicillin production wastewater effluent and downstream river. In both samples, the resistances to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics were more frequent, with much higher levels, than the other class antibiotics. Then five clinically important resistant genes mainly coding for extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBLs) were determined for all strains, only blaTEM-1 which did not belong to ESBL was detected in 17.3% and 11.0% of strains isolated from wastewater and downstream river respectively. Class I integrons were detected in 14% of wastewater isolates and 9.1% of downstream isolates, and primarily contained gene cassettes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. The unexpectedly high levels of multiple antibiotic resistance in strains from wastewater and downstream river were speculated to be mainly due to multidrug efflux systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

We used a shotgun metagenomic approach to examine the wide-spectrum profiles of ARGs (antibiotic resistance genes) and MGEs (mobile genetic elements) in activated sludge samples from two different hospital trains at the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Daegu, South Korea. The influent activated sludge and effluent of two trains (six samples in total) at WWTPs receiving domestic sewage wastewater (SWW) and hospital wastewater (HWW) samples collected at multiple periods were subjected to high throughput 16S rRNA metagenome sequencing for microbial community diversity. Cloacibacterium caeni and Lewinella nigricans were predominant in SWW effluents, while Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were predominant in HWW effluents based on the Miseq platform. Totally, 20,011 reads and 28,545 metagenomic sequence reads were assigned to 25 known ARG types in the SWW2 and HWW5 samples, respectively. The higher abundance of ARGs, including multidrug resistance (>53%, MDR), macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (>9%, MLS), beta-lactam (>3.3%), bacitracin (>4.4%), and tetracycline (>3.4%), confirmed the use of these antibiotics in human medicine. In total, 190 subtypes belonging to 23 antibiotic classes were detected in both SWW2 and HWW5 samples. RpoB2, MacB, and multidrug (MDR) ABC transporter shared the maximum matched genes in both activated sludge samples. The high abundance of MGEs, such as a gene transfer agent (GTA) (four times higher), transposable elements (1.6 times higher), plasmid related functions (3.8 times higher), and phages (two times higher) in HWW5 than in SWW2, revealed a risk of horizontal gene transfer in HWW. Domestic wastewater from hospital patients also influenced the abundance of ARGs and MGEs in the activated sludge process.},

Nineteen per cent of chloramphenicol resistant enteric bacteria of clinical origin, 11% of sewage isolates, and 11% of veterinary isolates gave positive hybridization results.The difference between bacteria of clinical and veterinary origin in respect of both parameters tested is significant and is interpreted as indicating genetic dis-similarity between the two pools in regard to chloramphenicol resistance.

This study was designed to demonstrate that carbapenemase-producing bacteria are disseminated from hospitals into the environment. To this end, resistant bacteria were isolated from a clinical/urban and from a rural catchment system in Germany in 2016/17. The study followed the dissemination of resistant bacteria from the wastewater through the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) into the receiving surface waters. The bacteria were cultivated on selective agar and characterized by antibiotic testing, real-time PCR targeting carbapenemase genes and typing. Bacteria with resistance to third generation cephalosporins were isolated from all sample sites. 134 isolates harboring carbapenemase genes encoding VIM, NDM and OXA-48 and 26 XDR (extensively drug-resistant) strains with susceptibility to only one or two antibiotics were isolated from the clinical/urban system. The rural system yielded eight carbapenemase producers and no XDR strains. In conclusion, clinical wastewaters were charged with a high proportion of multidrug resistant bacteria. Although most of these bacteria were eliminated during wastewater treatment, dissemination into surface waters is possible as single carbapenemase producers were still present in the effluent of the WWTP.},

abstract = {Objectives: Escherichia coli is one of the most potential agents of community and hospital-acquired infections, which can readily acquire non-susceptibility to drugs administered to animals and humans. E. coli, which has been broadly applied as an indicator of fecal contamination in aquatic environments, is routinely conducted non-virulence. Nevertheless, some isolates can be virulence. The main objectives of this work were to survey antibiotic non-susceptibility and to characterize virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes including traT, fimH, blaCTX, and tetA among the E. coli isolates recovered from sewage in Gonabad, in the northeast of Iran. Material(s) and Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, a total of 99 non-duplicate strains of E. coli was removed from three types of sewage including poultry (33 isolates), urban (33), and livestock slaughterhouse (33) sewages in Gonabad from May 2016 to April 2017. Then, the antimicrobial susceptibility test and extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) production were done based on CLSI guidelines, followed by performing the polymerase chain reaction technique to identify 2 virulence (traT and fimH) and 2 antibiotic resistance (blaCTX and tetA) genes. Result(s): Meropenem was the most effective drug against the strains. The analysis of multiple drug non-susceptibility profiles in the strains showed that 39 (39.3%) strains were TR-NAR and three (3.03%) of them were resistant to colistin. Totally, 21 (21.2%) strains were ESBL-positive and 15 (71.42%) ESBL+ isolates carried blaCTX gene whereas 87.9% and 100% of the strains in the livestock slaughterhouse and urban sewages carried the tetA gene, respectively. Finally, 85.7% of ESBL-positive isolates carried the fimH gene. Overall, 19.8% of ESBL-positive strains carried fimH and traT virulence genes (fimH+-traT+ genotype). Conclusion(s): Based on the findings of this study, wastewater and surface waters are considered as significant sources of E. coli carrying ESBL-genes, high levels of antibiotic non-susceptibility, and pathogenesis traits. Eventually, the identified colistin non-susceptible strains are quite worrying.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020 The Author(s.},

abstract = {The dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an escalating problem and a threat to public health. Comparative metagenomics was used to investigate the occurrence of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) in wastewater and urban surface water environments in Singapore. Hospital and municipal wastewater (n = 6) were found to have higher diversity and average abundance of ARGs (303 ARG subtypes, 197,816 x/Gb) compared to treated wastewater effluent (n = 2, 58 ARG subtypes, 2,692 x/Gb) and surface water (n = 5, 35 subtypes, 7,985 x/Gb). A cluster analysis showed that the taxonomic composition of wastewaters was highly similar and had a bacterial community composition enriched in gut bacteria (Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Roseburia, Ruminococcus), the Enterobacteriaceae group (Klebsiella, Aeromonas, Enterobacter) and opportunistic pathogens (Prevotella, Comamonas, Neisseria). Wastewater, treated effluents and surface waters had a shared resistome of 21 ARGs encoding multidrug resistant efflux pumps or resistance to aminoglycoside, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramins (MLS), quinolones, sulfonamide, and tetracycline resistance which suggests that these genes are wide spread across different environments. Wastewater had a distinctively higher average abundance of clinically relevant, class A beta-lactamase resistant genes (i.e., blaKPC, blaCTX-M, blaSHV, blaTEM). The wastewaters from clinical isolation wards, in particular, had a exceedingly high levels of blaKPC-2 genes (142,200 x/Gb), encoding for carbapenem resistance. Assembled scaffolds (16 and 30 kbp) from isolation ward wastewater samples indicated this gene was located on a Tn3-based transposon (Tn4401), a mobilization element found in Klebsiella pneumonia plasmids. In the longer scaffold, transposable elements were flanked by a toxin-antitoxin (TA) system and other metal resistant genes that likely increase the persistence, fitness and propagation of the plasmid in the bacterial host under conditions of stress. A few bacterial species (Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) that were cultured from the isolation ward wastewaters on CHROMagar media harbored the blaKPC-2 gene. This suggests that hospital wastewaters derived from clinical specialty wards are hotspots for the spread of AMR. Assembled scaffolds of other mobile genetic elements such as IncQ and IncF plasmids bearing quinolone resistance genes (qnrS1, qnrS2) and the class A beta-lactamase gene (blaTEM-1) were recovered in wastewater samples which may aid the transfer of AMR.},

abstract = {Municipal wastewater treatment plants are recognized reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Three municipal wastewater treatment plants differing on the dimensions and bio-treatment processes were compared for the loads of amoxicillin-, tetracycline-, and ciprofloxacin- resistant heterotrophic bacteria, enterobacteria, and enterococci in the raw inflow and in the treated effluents. The sewage received by each plant, in average, corresponded to 85,000 inhabitant equivalents (IE), including pretreated industrial effluents (<30%) in plant activated sludge, 105,000 IE, including pretreated hospital effluents (<15%) in plant trickling filter, and 2,000 IE, exclusively of domestic sewage, in plant submerged aerated filter. The presence of pretreated industrial effluents or of pretreated hospital sewage in the raw inflow did not imply significantly higher densities (per milliliter or per IE) of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the raw wastewater. Longer hydraulic residence periods (24 h) corresponded to higher bacterial removal rates than shorter periods (12 and 9 h), although such efficiency did not imply significant average decreases in the antibiotic resistance prevalence of the treated effluent. The bacterial loads in the treated effluent could be ranked according to the treatment efficiency, suggesting that the characteristics of the raw inflow may have less relevance on the quality of the treated wastewater than other aspects, such as the inflow volume, the type of biological treatment, or the hydraulic residence time. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Bacterial diversity and antimicrobial resistance patterns among the indicator organism Escherichia coli were monitored in wastewater samples collected over one year from a hospital (HW), a community (CW) and the receiving urban (UW) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We compared levels of antibiotic resistance in the different types of wastewater, and identified whether resistant strains were endemic in the wastewater system. If so, implementation of local treatment at certain resistance hotspots (e.g. hospital outlets) could be used to decrease the amount of resistant bacteria in the wastewater. E. coli from HW (n = 2644), CW (n = 2525) and UW (n = 2693) were analyzed by biochemical phenotyping (PhenePlate System) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to nine antibiotics (AREB System). The phenotypic diversities of the total E. coli populations were similar for all three sites (Simpson's Diversity index, Di = 0.973), however for individual samples, HW showed low diversities (Median Di = 0.800) and the E. coli flora was often dominated by strains that may have originated from the fecal flora of single individuals. The diversities in CW samples was higher (Median Di = 0.936), and UW samples showed similar diversities as the whole collection of isolates (Median Di = 0.971). Resistance to at least one of the nine antibiotics was observed in 45% of the HW isolates, 44% of CW isolates, and 33% of UW isolates. Resistance to gentamicin and chloramphenicol was uncommon (3.2 and 5.3%, respectively), whereas resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin was most common (24% and 31%, respectively). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC) were more common in HW (11.5%) and in CW (6.9%) compared to UW (3.7%). A high diversity (Di = 0.974) was observed among ESBL-EC isolates from UW (n = 99), indicating absence of any clonal structure among these isolates. Common PhP types of ESBL-EC often dominated in each HW sample, but were not identified across different samples, whereas ESBL-EC in CW showed low diversity (Di = 0.857) and were dominated by a specific PhP type that was found across almost all CW samples. The antibiotic resistance rates were highest in hospital wastewater, but surprisingly they were also high in the studied community wastewater, compared to the urban wastewater. The relative contribution of HW seemed low in terms of dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria to the WWTP.},

abstract = {This study quantified antibiotic and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) concentrations in hospital and communal wastewaters as well as the influents and effluents of the receiving urban wastewater treatment plants (UWWTP) in two Dutch cities. In only one city, hospital wastewater was treated on-site using advanced technologies, including membrane bioreactor treatment (MBR), ozonation, granulated activated carbon (GAC) and UV-treatment. On-site hospital wastewater (HWW) treatment reduced gene presence of hospital-related antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic concentrations in the receiving urban wastewater treatment plant. These findings support the need for on-site treatment of high-risk point sources of antibiotic resistance genes. 13 antibiotic resistance genes, Integrase Class 1 and 16S rRNA concentrations were quantified using multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays and the presence and/or concentration of 711 antibiotics were analyzed. Hospital wastewater contained approximately 25% more antibiotics and gene concentrations between 0.4 log to 1.8-fold higher than communal wastewater (CWW). blaKPC and vanA could be identified as hospital-related genes and were reduced to under the limit of detection (LOD) during on-site treatment. Advanced on-site treatment removed between 0.5 and 3.6-fold more genes than conventional biological urban wastewater treatment (activated sludge). Advanced on-site treatment was able to eliminate 12 out of 19 detected antibiotics, while urban waste water treatment eliminated up to 1 (out of 21 detected). Different advanced treatment technologies were able to target different pollutants to varying extents, making sequential alignment more effective. MBR treatment was most efficient in antibiotic resistance gene reduction and ozonation in antibiotic reduction. blaKPC could only be detected in the influent of the urban wastewater treatment plant receiving untreated hospital wastewater. Similarly, vanA was only consistently detected in this treatment plant. These results indicate a positive effect of on-site treatment of hospital wastewater on the communal sewage system.},

The current study investigates the distribution of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) in four sewage treatment plants (STPs) in South India receiving hospital and domestic wastewater in different proportions. A total of 221 E. coli isolates were checked for antimicrobial resistance against 16 antimicrobials. Among the antimicrobials tested, ampicillin (AMP) and cefazolin (CFZ) showed resistance between 20% and 90%, nalidixic acid (NAL) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) showed resistance between 15% and 75% and chloramphenicol (CHL) showed resistance between 2% and 20%. Based on the observations, there is no significant difference between the wastewater inlet and outlet, suggesting that treatment process was not effective in reducing the resistance. In conclusion, the trends of antimicrobial resistance pattern show that the levels of resistance were slightly higher in hospital wastewater than domestic wastewater.},

abstract = {Background: Pakistan is currently facing the largest outbreak of ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi described to date. Here we aimed to report the outbreak investigation done in Hyderabad, Pakistan, and identify disease risk factors. Methods: We did an age-matched case-control (1:4) study, in which cases of ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi were identified from active sentinal sites (three hospitals in Hyderabad, Pakistan), community, and laboratory-based surveillance. Ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi infection (ie, resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, fluoroquinole, and ceftriaxone) was confirmed using blood culture. Healthy participants (controls) were enrolled for the first 200 people (cases) with ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi. A structured questionnaire was administered to identify exposures 4 weeks before the illness (cases) or enrolment (controls). Cases were included if written informed consent was provided. Four controls were selected from the same community as the corresponding case, matched on age, being healthy at the time of enrolment, and with no febrile illness in the 4 weeks before enrolment. Samples of drinking water from households and community water sources (ie, hand pumps or taps in common areas outside households) were collected for testing. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk factors for ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi outbreak in Hyderabad. Findings: Between Nov 30, 2016, and Dec 30, 2017, 486 people with ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi were identified from Hyderabad. Of the 486 cases, 296 (61%) were male and 447 (92%) were aged 15 years or younger. Several factors were significantly associated with acquisition of ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi, including male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1{\textperiodcentered}53, 95% CI 1{\textperiodcentered}06–2{\textperiodcentered}21), eating outside of the house (aOR 1{\textperiodcentered}48, 1{\textperiodcentered}01–2{\textperiodcentered}19), exposure to a patient with S Typhi infection (aOR 3{\textperiodcentered}81, 2{\textperiodcentered}21–6{\textperiodcentered}83), and a history of antimicrobial use (aOR 4{\textperiodcentered}25, 2{\textperiodcentered}53–7{\textperiodcentered}13). Nine (69%) of 13 water samples taken from the households of people with ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi infection were positive for Escherichia coli, indicating faecal contamination. S Typhi DNA was detected in 12 (22%) of 55 water samples from community water sources. Geospatial mapping showed clustering of cases around sewerage lines. Interpretation: Hyderabad faces the largest reported outbreak of ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi. The outbreak is suspected to be attributed to the contaminated drinking water, especially the mixing of sewage with drinking water. The risk of ceftriaxone-resistant S Typhi infection is increased among children aged 15 years and younger, male individuals, and those eating outside the house. Vaccination and chlorination of water are recommended for the containment of the outbreak. Funding: None.},

abstract = {Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are an effective barrier in the protection of human and environment health around the world, although WWTPs also are suggested to be selectors and-or reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) before entering the environment. The dogma about WWTPs as “ARG selectors” presumes that biotreatment compartments (e.g., activated sludge; AS) are single densely populated ecosystems with elevated horizontal gene transfer. However, recent work has suggested WWTP biotreatment compartments may be different than previously believed relative to antibiotic resistance (AR) fate, and other process factors, such as bacterial separation and specific waste sources, may be key to ARGs released to the environment. Here we combined 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing and high-throughput qPCR to characterise microbial communities and ARGs across a wastewater network in Spain that includes both community (i.e., non-clinical urban) and hospital sources. Contrary to expectations, ARGs found in downstream receiving waters were not dominated by AS biosolids (RAS), but more resembled raw wastewater sources. In fact, ARGs and microbial communities in liquid-phase WWTP effluents and RAS were significantly different (Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index = 0.66 ± 0.11), with a consequential fraction of influent ARGs and organisms passing directly through the WWTP with limited association with RAS. Instead, ARGs and organisms in the RAS may be more defined by biosolids separation and biophysical traits, such as flocculation, rather than ARG carriage. This explains why RAS has significantly lower ARG richness (47 ± 4 ARGs) than liquid-phase effluents (104 ± 5 ARGs), and downstream water column (135 ± 4 ARGs) and river sediments (120 ± 5 ARGs) (Tukey's test, p < 0.001). These data suggest RAS and liquid-phase WWTP effluents may reflect two parallel ecosystems with potentially limited ARG exchange. As such, ARG mitigation in WWTPs should more focus on removing bacterial hosts from the liquid phase, AR source reduction, and possibly disinfection to reduce ARG releases to the environment.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the influence of a duckweed aquaculture based hospital sewage water recycling plant on the prevalence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance, we made use of an existing collection of 1,315 Aeromonas isolates that were previously typed by the biochemical fingerprinting PhP-AE system. In these treatment plant, hospital raw sewage water is first collected in a settlement pond (referred to as sewage water in this study) and is then transferred to a lagoon, where the duckweed (Lemnaceae) is grown (referred to as lagoon). The duckweed is harvested and used as feed for the fish in a separate pond (referred to as fish pond). From this collection, representatives of 288 PhP types were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing for eight antimicrobials by broth microdilution method. The overall resistance rates among Aeromonas isolates from the treatment plant were highest for ampicillin (87%) and erythromycin (79%) followed by cephalothin (58%), nalidixic acid (52%), streptomycin (51%), tetracycline (31%), chloramphenicol (13%) and gentamicin (8%). A significantly lower prevalence of antibiotic resistance was found in Aeromonas from environmental control water, patient stool samples, duckweed and fish compared to sewage water isolates. The prevalence of resistance in the sewage water was not significantly reduced compared to the lagoon water and fish pond. Throughout the treatment system, the frequencies of resistant strains were found to diminish during the sewage water purification process, i.e. in the lagoon where sewage water is used to grow the duckweed. However, the frequency of resistant strains again increased in the fish pond where sewage grown duckweed is used for aquaculture. Among the selected isolates, two multiresistant clonal groups of Aeromonas caviae HG4 were identified that exhibited indistinguishable PhP and amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprints and shared a common plasmid of approximately 5 kb. Representatives of both groups were recovered from almost every part of the sewage treatment plant but not in the control ponds nor in human samples, which suggests that specific multiresistant Aeromonas clones are able to persist and spread throughout the entire purification process. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) carrying antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) have been increasingly detected in water sources. Pseudomonas sp. are opportunistic pathogens commonly reported in water samples and different antimicrobial resistance mechanisms have been described in Pseudomonas sp., producing multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype. Besides, the presence of heavy metal resistance genes (HMRGs) may select ARB, which is worrying. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the genotypes of Pseudomonas sp. isolated from different water sources. Water samples (i.e., rivers, streams, lakes and sewage treatment plants) were collected from different cities in Brazil. The bacterial identification was performed by sequencing the 16S rDNA and the resistance profile to antimicrobials and heavy metals were determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Several ARGs, HMRGs, and plasmids were researched by PCR and the amplicons were sequenced for confirmation. A total of 23 Pseudomonas sp. isolates were obtained and identified as Pseudomonas saponiphila, Pseudomonas hunanensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas asiatica. These isolates presented high MICs to antimicrobials and heavy metals, being the great majority (n = 21; 91%) classified as MDR. Different clinically important ARGs were detected, such as blaGES, qnrS, qepA, tetB, aac(3′)-IIa, and ant(2″)-Ia. The czcA gene was the only HMRG detected and no plasmids were found. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the world of P. saponiphila carrying ARGs (i.e., blaGES, qnrS, aac(3′)-IIa, tetB) and QepA-producing P. hunanensis and the first time of P. saponiphila, P. asiatica, and P. hunanensis in Brazil.},

abstract = {Environmental dissemination of antimicrobial resistance is a global health problem. Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) are constantly released into the environment through effluents (EFs) from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Thus, requiring a better understanding of the selection and fate of ARGs in wastewater treatment processes. Therefore, we investigated the impacts of urban WWTP EFs on receiving water in the context of their resistomes and mobilomes. We used a HiSeq-based short read metagenomic approach to address the dynamics and diversity of ARGs in WWTP EF as well as the upstream (UP) and downstream (DN) river waters, followed by an investigation of plasmid-mediated ARGs. The abundance of ARGs at each site varied from 7.2 × 10−2 to 7.4 × 10−1 ARG copies per 16S rRNA gene copy, and EF samples showed the highest abundance, followed by DN and UP water samples. ARG diversity ranged from 121 to 686 types per site, and EF had the most diverse ARGs. Commonly identified ARGs in the EF and DN samples were clinically important and were absent in UP samples. The abundance of ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and plasmid contigs found only in EF and DN were positively correlated with each other, indicating the importance of mobilomes in the dissemination of ARGs in the environment. Moreover, the proportions of plasmid-mediated ARGs was highest in the EF samples, followed by the DN and UP samples. These findings suggest that WWTP EF may act as a driving factor shaping the resistomes and mobilomes of receiving waters. In particular, a higher abundance of plasmid-mediated ARGs in WWTP EF suggests higher transmissibility in the DN environment.},

abstract = {For some time now, antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains have been found in the human population, in foods, in livestock and wild animals, as well as in surface waters. The entry of antibiotics and resistant bacterial strains into the environment plays an important role in the spread of antibiotic resistance. The goal of the present study was to monitor the entry of antibiotic resistances into the environment through the contamination of wastewater. To assess the extent of transmission of antibiotic resistances from human sources into the environment, the resistance patterns of Escherichia coli strains isolated from human patients have been compared to those found in strains isolated from sewage sludge. Our results may indicate if resistances to particular antibiotics are more prone than others to spread into the environment. To monitor the increase of specific resistances over time, samples taken in the years 2000 and 2009 were analysed. Our study shows that for some antibiotics a parallel development of resistance patterns has taken place in both patient and environmental samples over time. For other sets of antibiotics, independent developments have occurred in the samples. A clear increase of multi-resistant E. coli strains over time was observed in samples from both sources. {\textcopyright} IWA Publishing 2013.},

Investigations have been done in sewage, sludge and receiving waters from three different sewage treatment plants in southern Austria. A total of 767 E. coli isolates were tested regarding their resistance to 24 different antibiotics. The highest resistance rates were found in E. coli strains of a sewage treatment plant which treats not only municipal sewage but also sewage from a hospital. Among the antimicrobial agents tested, the highest resistance rates in the penicillin group were found for Ampicillin (AM) (up to 18%) and Piperacillin (PIP) (up to 12%); in the cephalosporin group for Cefalothin (CF) (up to 35%) and Cefuroxime-Axetil (CXMAX) (up to 11%); in the group of quinolones for Nalidixic acid (NA) (up to 15%); and for Trimethoprime/Sulfamethoxazole (SXT) (up to 13%) and for Tetracycline (TE) (57%). Median values for E. coli in the inflow (crude sewage) of the plants were between 2.0×104 and 6.1×104CFU/ml (Coli ID-agar, BioMerieux 42017) but showed a 200-fold reduction in all three plants in the effluent. Nevertheless, more than 102CFU E. coli/ml reached the receiving water and thus sewage treatment processes contribute to the dissemination of resistant bacteria in the environment. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {We studied the prevalences of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and multiple antimicrobial resistance (MAR) among the fecal bacteria found in the rivers of a large watershed under strong anthropogenic pressures, the Seine river watershed (France). Two groups of fecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci, were tested for their susceptibility to 16 and 10 antimicrobials respectively, using the disk diffusion method. We found that 42% of the 214 E. coli river isolates were AR (resistant to at least one antimicrobial) and 35% were MAR (resistant to at least two antimicrobials). Among the 148 intestinal enterococci isolates from rivers, 83% were AR and 49% were MAR. We also investigated the sources of AR fecal bacteria found in the rivers of the watershed. A total of 715 E. coli isolates and 476 intestinal enterococci isolates were collected in point sources (municipal and hospital wastewaters) and non-point sources (surface runoff and soil leaching waters from agricultural or forest areas). For E. coli, the prevalence of AR differed widely from source to source and ranked in this order: hospital wastewaters (71%) > municipal wastewaters (44%) > agricultural non-point sources (16%) > forest non-point sources (2%). The prevalence of MAR ranked similarly, and the same trend was observed for intestinal enterococci. The AR level of fecal bacteria in the sources was related to their expected exposure level to antimicrobials before their release into the environment. A MAR index was calculated for every source and a good discrimination between them was thus obtained. At the global scale of the Seine river watershed, domestic wastewaters seemed more likely to be the predominant source of the AR fecal bacteria found in the rivers. This was corroborated by the similarity of the MAR indices from river and municipal wastewater isolates for both fecal indicators. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Klebsiella pneumoniae followed by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes and Acinetobacter baumannii were the predominant isolates. Antibiotic sensitivity of these isolates was determined by Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method. Nearly 60% of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates screened were multidrug resistant of which 16.6% were carbapenem resistant. The carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were further screened for the presence of New Delhi metallo $\beta$-lactamase-1 and cephalosporin resistance encoding genes. All NDM-1 isolates were highly resistant to carbapenem, cephalosporin, aminoglycosides, quinolones, tetracycline, and sulphonamides. K. pneumoniae harboring blaNDM-1 gene and E. coli isolates with blaCTX-M-15 and blaSHV-11 genes were detected in hospital discharge points. In aquaculture farms too, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae with blaNDM-1 gene and E. coli isolates with blaCTX-M-15 were observed, although there was no use of antibiotics in these farms. However, other carbapenemase genes such as blaTEM, blaVIM, blaIMP and blaGIM were not detected in any of these isolates. The results suggest the increased prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the water bodies receiving hospital effluent and its dissemination to adjacent aquaculture farms, posing a serious threat to public health.},

abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and genetic characteristics of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in hospital sewage and river water in the Philippines, which has a typical tropical maritime climate. We collected 83 water samples from 7 hospital sewage and 10 river water sites. CPE were identified using CHROMagar mSuperCARBA, and Gram-negative strains were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) or 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Resistance genes in Enterobacteriaceae strains were identified using PCR and DNA sequencing, and transferability of carbapenemase genes from the CPE was investigated with conjugation experiments. Genotyping was performed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Out of 124 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, we identified 51 strains as CPE and divided these into 7 species, 11 E. coli, 14 Klebsiella spp., 15 Enterobacter spp., and 11 others, including 4 additional species. Conjugation experiments via broth mating and using E. coli J53 revealed that 24 isolates can transfer carbapenemase-encoding plasmids. MLST analysis showed that 6 of 11 E. coli isolates belonged to clonal complex 10 (CC10). Of 11 K. pneumoniae strains, 9 unique sequence types (STs) were identified, including ST147. Five types of carbapenemase genes were identified, with the most prevalent being NDM (n = 39), which is epidemic in clinical settings in the Philippines. E. coli CC10 and K. pneumoniae ST147, which are often detected in clinical settings, were the dominant strains. In summary, our results indicate that hospital sewage and river water are contaminated by CPE strains belonging to clinically important clonal groups. Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) cause severe health care-associated infections, and their increasing prevalence is a serious concern. Recently, natural ecosystems have been recognized as important reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes. We investigated the prevalence and genetic characteristics of CPE isolated from the environment (hospital sewage and river water) in the Philippines and found several CPE, including Escherichia coli and other species, with different carbapenemases. The most prevalent carbapenemase gene type was NDM, which is endemic in clinical settings. This study revealed that isolates belonging to carbapenemase-producing E. coli CC10 and K. pneumoniae sequence type 147 (ST147), which are often detected in clinical settings, were dominant in the natural environment. Our work here provides a report on the presence and characteristics of CPE in the environment in the Philippines and demonstrates that both hospital sewage and river water are contaminated by CPE strains belonging to clinically important clonal groups.},

abstract = {The isolation of antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB) from wildlife living adjacent to humans has led to the suggestion that such antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is anthropogenically driven by exposure to antimicrobials and ARB. However, ARB have also been detected in wildlife living in areas without interaction with humans. Here, we investigated patterns of resistance in Escherichia coli isolated from 408 wild bird and mammal faecal samples. AMR and multi-drug resistance (MDR) prevalence in wildlife samples differed significantly between a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP; wastes of antibiotic-treated humans) and a Farm site (antibiotic-treated livestock wastes) and Central site (no sources of wastes containing anthropogenic AMR or antimicrobials), but patterns of resistance also varied significantly over time and between mammals and birds. Over 30% of AMR isolates were resistant to colistin, a last-resort antibiotic, but resistance was not due to the mcr-1 gene. ESBL and AmpC activity were common in isolates from mammals. Wildlife were, therefore, harbouring resistance of clinical relevance. AMR E. coli, including MDR, were found in diverse wildlife species, and the patterns and prevalence of resistance were not consistently associated with site and therefore different exposure risks. We conclude that AMR in commensal bacteria of wildlife is not driven simply by anthropogenic factors, and, in practical terms, this may limit the utility of wildlife as sentinels of spatial variation in the transmission of environmental AMR.},

abstract = {This study pertains to measure differences in bacterial communities along the wastewater pathway, from sewage sources through the environment. Our main focus was on taxa which include pathogenic genera, and genera harboring antibiotic resistance (henceforth referred to as “target taxa”). Our objective was to measure the relative abundance of these taxa in clinical wastewaters compared to non-clinical wastewaters, and to investigate what changes can be detected along the wastewater pathway. The study entailed a monthly sampling campaign along a wastewater pathway, and taxa identification through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Results indicated that clinical and non-clinical wastewaters differed in their overall bacterial composition, but that target taxa were not enriched in clinical wastewater. This suggests that treatment of clinical wastewater before release into the wastewater system would only remove a minor part of the potential total pathogen load in wastewater treatment plants. Additional findings were that the relative abundance of most target taxa was decreased after wastewater treatment, yet all investigated taxa were detected in 68% of the treated effluent samples—meaning that these bacteria are continuously released into the receiving surface water. Temporal variation was only observed for specific taxa in surface water, but not in wastewater samples.},

abstract = {The high use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has led to a wide spread of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance into the environment. In recent years, various studies have shown that antibiotic residues, resistant bacteria and resistance genes, occur in aquatic environments and that clinical wastewater seems to be a hot spot for the environmental spread of antibiotic resistance. Here a representative statistical analysis of various sampling points is presented, containing different proportions of clinically influenced wastewater. The statistical analysis contains the calculation of the odds ratios for any combination of antibiotics with resistant bacteria or resistance genes, respectively. The results were screened for an increased probability of detecting resistant bacteria, or resistance genes, with the simultaneous presence of antibiotic residues. Positive associated sets were then compared, with regards to the detected median concentration, at the investigated sampling points. All results show that the sampling points with the highest proportion of clinical wastewater always form a distinct cluster concerning resistance. The results shown in this study lead to the assumption that ciprofloxacin is a good indicator of the presence of multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa and extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella spec., Enterobacter spec. and Citrobacter spec., as it positively relates with both parameters. Furthermore, a precise relationship between carbapenemase genes and meropenem, regarding the respective sampling sites, could be obtained.

Due to the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance, assurance of the antibacterial effectiveness of these substances has moved into the focus of public health. The reduction in antibiotic residues in wastewater and the environment may play a decisive role in the development of increasing rates of antibiotic resistance. The present study examines the wastewater of 31 patient rooms of various German clinics for possible residues of antibiotics, as well as the wastewater of five private households as a reference. To the best of our knowledge, this study shows for the first time that in hospitals with high antibiotic consumption rates, residues of these drugs can be regularly detected in toilets, sink siphons and shower drains at concentrations ranging from 0.02 $\mu$g{\textperiodcentered}L −1 to a maximum of 79 mg{\textperiodcentered}L −1 . After complete flushing of the wastewater siphons, antibiotics are no longer detectable, but after temporal stagnation, the concentration of the active substances in the water phases of respective siphons increases again, suggesting that antibiotics persist through the washing process in biofilms. This study demonstrates that clinical wastewater systems offer further possibilities for the optimization of antibiotic resistance surveillance.},

Here, we employed whole genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate the presence/absence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence-associated (VA) genes in a collection of clinical and municipal wastewater Escherichia coli isolates from Kakamega, west Kenya. We were particularly interested to see whether, given the association between infection and water quality, the isolates from these geographically-linked environments might display similar genomic signatures. Phylogenetic analysis based on the core genes common to all of the isolates revealed two broad divisions, corresponding to the commensal/enterotoxigenic E. coli on the one hand, and uropathogenic E. coli on the other. Although the clinical and wastewater isolates each contained a very similar mean number of antibiotic resistance-encoding genes, the clinical isolates were enriched in genes required for in-host survival. Furthermore, and although the chromosomally encoded repertoire of these genes was similar in all sequenced isolates, the genetic composition of the plasmids from clinical and wastewater E. coli was more habitat-specific, with the clinical isolate plasmidome enriched in AMR and VA genes. Intriguingly, the plasmid-borne VA genes were often duplicates of genes already present on the chromosome, whereas the plasmid-borne AMR determinants were more specific. This reinforces the notion that plasmids are a primary means by which infection-related AMR and VA-associated genes are acquired and disseminated among these strains.},

As this is the first reported sequence of an ST111 strain, the genome was examined in depth, focusing particularly on antibiotic resistance and potential virulence genes, and on the reported regions of genome plasticity. High degrees of sequence similarity were discovered between outbreak isolates collected from recently infected patients, isolates from sinks, an isolate from the sewer, and a historical isolate, suggesting that the ST111 strain has been endemic in the hospital for many years. The ability to translate easily from outbreak investigation to detailed genome biology by use of the same data demonstrates the flexibility of WGS application in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {The wide spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in the environment is an emerging environmental issue with potentially-serious public health implications. However, carbapenemase-producing Citrobacter from environment has rarely been investigated. Here we report the isolation and comparative genomics of carbapenemase-producing Citrobacter isolates from river sediment in China. Potential CPE was isolated by selective MacConkey agar plates containing 2 mg/L meropenem. The presence of carbapenemase genes was detected by PCR and sequencing. The clonal relatedness of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC-2)-producing Citrobacter isolates was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing. Plasmid analysis of KPC-2-producing Citrobacter isolates was performed by S1-PFGE, Southern blotting, and whole genome sequencing. A total of four KPC-2-producing Citrobacter and three Aeromonas isolates were recovered from 54 sediment cultures of Shifeng River. Notably, all KPC-producing isolates were isolated from sampling sites near a waste water treatment plant. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that three of the four sequenced isolates (C1710, C191, and C196) resistant to multiple antibiotics. Genotyping and pan-genome analyses revealed that the C191 and C196 C. freundii isolates exhibited a high level of genetic similarity. Plasmid analysis confirmed that the blaKPC-2 gene is located on either IncF or IncN3 plasmids in all isolates. The blaKPC-2 gene of C1710, C181 and C191 was successfully transferred with E. coli EC600 as the recipient strain. In silico analysis further suggested that pKPC-191 is a novel IncF plasmid, with 99% identity to two previously described IncFII plasmids at 71% coverage. We report here the presence of diverse conjugative blaKPC-2 plasmids from environmental Citrobacter isolates, which poses the possible dissemination of antimicrobial resistance into clinical isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first study to culture and characterize KPC-2-producing Citrobacter isolates from river sediments in China.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistant bacteria are widespread in aquatic environments. The aim of the present study was to obtain information on the occurrence of bacteria with antimicrobial resistance and their multiple antimicrobial resistance (MAR) patterns in a river basin in Japan. In addition, the occurrence of fecal bacteria producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) in the aquatic environment was determined. Among the Escherichia coli isolates recovered from river samples upstream, 55% isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial and 18% were MAR. Among the E. coli isolates recovered from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent samples, 74% isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial and 46% were MAR. These findings suggest that the presence of WWTP effluent will increase the degree of contamination with MAR in the aquatic environment. Among the ampicillin-resistant isolates recovered from river samples, 21% isolates were judged as ESBL-producing and none (0%) was judged as MBL-producing. Among the ampicillin-resistant isolates recovered from WWTP effluent samples, 21% were judged as ESBL-producing and 1% was judged as MBL-producing. As for the hospital wastewater samples, 48% were judged as ESBL-producing and 3% were judged as MBL-producing. The percentage of ESBLs and MBL production was highest in hospital wastewater samples. All of the ESBL-producing isolates detected had resistance to ampicillin, cephazolin, and cefpodoxime and many ESBL-producers had resistance not only to beta-lactams but also to other kinds of antimicrobials such as aminoglycosides and quinolones. The frequency of detection of MBL-producers was much lower than that of ESBL-producers and MBL-producers were not detected in the river samples. However, the detection in WWTP effluent samples indicated that bacteria with MBL were present downstream of the WWTP at low concentrations. Thus, ESBLs and MBL have already been spread around aquatic environments.},

abstract = {Aims: To compare bacterial populations and antimicrobial resistance patterns between clinical and sewage isolates from a regional hospital in northern Taiwan. The dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from hospital compartments to the hospital sewage treatment plant was examined. Methods and Results: A total of 1020 clinical isolates and 435 sewage isolates were collected between July and September 2005. The percentages of Gram-negative bacteria from the clinical and sewage isolates were 87{\textperiodcentered}2% and 91{\textperiodcentered}0%, respectively (P = 0{\textperiodcentered}033). Escherichia coli were the leading bacterial isolates in both groups. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed a significant difference (P < 0{\textperiodcentered}001) in resistance to ampicillin (85{\textperiodcentered}6%vs 94{\textperiodcentered}1%), ampicillin/sulbactam (31{\textperiodcentered}7%vs 55{\textperiodcentered}4%), cefazolin (29{\textperiodcentered}2%vs 71{\textperiodcentered}5%) and cefuroxime (20{\textperiodcentered}7%vs 61{\textperiodcentered}9%) between clinical and sewage coliform isolates, respectively. Conclusions: The sewage isolates had higher antimicrobial resistance rates than the clinical isolates from the same hospital. Significance and Impact of the Study: The low efficacy of the hospital sewage treatment may contribute to the dissemination of multidrug resistant bacteria from this hospital compartments to the environment. Practices which limit the disposal of antimicrobial agents into the wastewater system may be the possible measure to prevent the selection of multidrug-resistant bacteria from sewage treatment plants. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Society for Applied Microbiology.},

The abundance of ARGs (blaCTX-M, sul1, and aac-(6′)-1b-cr) was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR). High prevalence of the int1 gene (66.7%) was found in the phage-particle DNA of tested samples, followed by sul1 (41.7%), sul2 (33.3%), blaCTX-M (33.3%), aac-(6′)-lb-cr (25%), aph(3′)-IIIa (16.7%), and ermF (8.3%). The qPCR data showed higher gene copy (GC) numbers in samples collected near a hospital (site 7) and a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) (site 10) (P <.05). Particularly the absolute abundance of aac-(6′)-lb-cr gene was significantly higher than the blaCTX-M and sul1 genes with the gene copy (GC) numbers of 5.73 log10 copy/mL for site 7 and 4.99 log10 copy/mL for site 10. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to report the presence of sul2, aac-(6′)-lb-cr, ermF and aph(3′)-IIIa genes in bacteriophage DNA derived from aquatic environments.

abstract = {Sewage spills can release antibiotic-resistant bacteria into surface waters, contributing to environmental reservoirs and potentially impacting human health. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are nosocomial pathogens that have been detected in environmental habitats, including soil, water, and beach sands, as well as wildlife feces. However, VRE harboring vanA genes that confer high-level resistance have infrequently been found outside clinical settings in the United States. This study found culturable Enterococcus faecium harboring the vanA gene in water and sediment for up to 3 days after a sewage spill, and the quantitative PCR (qPCR) signal for vanA persisted for an additional week. Culturable levels of enterococci in water exceeded recreational water guidelines for 2 weeks following the spill, declining about five orders of magnitude in sediments and two orders of magnitude in the water column over 6 weeks. Analysis of bacterial taxa via 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed changes in community structure through time following the sewage spill in sediment and water. The spread of opportunistic pathogens harboring high-level vancomycin resistance genes beyond hospitals and into the broader community and associated habitats is a potential threat to public health, requiring further studies that examine the persistence, occurrence, and survival of VRE in different environmental matrices.},

Thirty-five isolates of multiple antibiotic-resistant Escherichia spp. were further screened to detect 61 ARGs, 18 mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and gene cassettes. The isolates from livestock manure and MWWTPs showed greater diversity in plasmid profiling than hospital wastewater. Each Escherichia sp. carried 21–26 ARGs and 8–12 MGEs. In addition, 11 gene cassettes were detected in 34 Escherichia isolates, with greater diversity in livestock manure and MWWTPs than in hospital wastewater. The results indicated that the potential for ARG transfer was higher in livestock manure and MWWTPs compared with human clinical sources, possibly related to the high occurrence of both residual antibiotics and heavy metals in these environments.},

abstract = {Some heavy metals have antimicrobial activity and are considered as potential alternatives to traditional antibiotic therapy. However, heavy metal tolerance genes (HMTG) have been already detected and coding different tolerance mechanisms. Considering that certain metals are promising for antimicrobial therapy, evaluation of HMTG dissemination in bacteria from sewage is essential to understand the evolution of these bacteria and to predict antimicrobial use and control. The present study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of bacteria carrying HMTG in samples of hospital wastewater and from urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The acquired HMTG were investigated by PCR in bacterial collection previously characterized for antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs). HMTG searched include arsB (arsenic efflux pump), czcA (cadmium, zinc and cobalt efflux pump), merA (mercuric reductase), pcoD (copper efflux pump), silA (silver efflux pump) and terF (tellurite resistance protein). Among 45 isolates, 82% of them carried at last one HMTG, in which the silA and pcoD tolerance genes were the most prevalent. A very strong positive correlation was found between these genes (r = 0.91, p < 0.0001). Tolerance genes merA, arsB, czcA and terF were detected in 47%, 13%, 13% and 7% of the isolates, respectively. It was found that 15 isolates co-harbored ARGs ($\beta$-lactamase encoding genes). HMTG are probably more dispersed than ARGs in bacteria, representing a new concern for heavy metals use as effective antimicrobials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the HMTG searched in Hafnia alvei, Serratia fonticola and Serratia liquefaciens. Hospital wastewater treatment implementation and additional technologies for treatment in WWTP can reduce the impacts on water resources and HMTG spread, ensureing the environmental and human health safety.},

abstract = {A growing body of evidence indicates that anthropogenic activities can result in increased prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in bacteria in natural environments. Many environmental studies have used next-generation sequencing methods to sequence the metagenome. However, this approach is limited as it does not identify divergent uncharacterized genes or demonstrate activity. Characterization of ARGs in environmental metagenomes is important for understanding the evolution and dissemination of resistance, as there are several examples of clinically important resistance genes originating in environmental species. The current study employed a functional metagenomic approach to detect genes encoding resistance to extended spectrum $\beta$-lactams (ESBLs) and carbapenems in sewage sludge, sludge amended soil, quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) impacted reed bed sediment and less impacted long term curated grassland soil. ESBL and carbapenemase genes were detected in sewage sludge, sludge amended soils and QAC impacted soil with varying degrees of homology to clinically important $\beta$-lactamase genes. The flanking regions were sequenced to identify potential host background and genetic context. Novel $\beta$-lactamase genes were found in Gram negative bacteria, with one gene adjacent to an insertion sequence ISPme1, suggesting a recent mobilization event and/ the potential for future transfer. Sewage sludge and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) rich industrial effluent appear to disseminate and/or select for ESBL genes which were not detected in long term curated grassland soils. This work confirms the natural environment as a reservoir of novel and mobilizable resistance genes, which may pose a threat to human and animal health.},

This study aimed at detecting the occurrence of sulfonamide resistance genes and antibiogram of sulfonamide-resistant bacteria (SRB) isolated from sewage, aquaculture sources, animal wastes and hospital wastewater. Methods: SRB were isolated on medium incorporated with sulfadiazine (SDZ). Antibiotic susceptibility was carried out using disc diffusion method, while detection of sul1, sul2 and sul3 genes was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. Results: A total of forty-eight SRB; aquaculture (8), animal wastes (16), hospital wastewater (10) and sewage (14) belonging to sixteen genera were obtained, with Pseudomonas spp. and Bacillus spp. predominating. In the Gram-negative SRB, there was 100% resistance to ertapenem, tetracycline (77.5%), ampicillin (75%), cefpodoxime (47.5%), streptomycin (27.5%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (22.5%), ciprofloxacin (22.5%), imipenem (15%), cefotaxime (12.5%) and ceftazidime (7.5%). In the Gram-positive SRB, there was 100% resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and ertapenem, while 50% and 12.5% respectively were resistant to cefpodoxime and imipenem. No resistance was observed to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin. 85.4% of the SRB were multidrug resistant (MDR). sul1 was detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa H19A (hospital wastewater), Bacillus sp.

abstract = {Although, there are a global spread of studies on Providencia genus, it has been studied very little or rare in Middle East countries especially in Iraq. Species of these bacteria are verified presence, which are an uncommon as opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised people or common in environment. It's gram negative bacilli belong to the family of Enterobacteriaceae. Due to wide and indiscriminate use of antibiotics, major problem has emerged the multi-drug resistance (MDR) of these bacteria. The samples were collected from different sources (n = 1209), which included clinical, environmental and food specimens from Al-Diwaniya city in September 2016 to December 2017. Patients profile included gender and age. The strainswere identified, as well as, screened for antibiotic susceptibility pattern and for the presence of $\beta$-Lactamases. Moreover, the bacteria were stratified into MDR, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pandrug-resistant (PDR) depending on specific international standardized. The results of 1209 specimens were examinedas 684(63.39%) positive clinical and environmental cultures, 18(2.63%) strains were identified as Providencia species. Of these, 3 (0.44%) strains from respiratory tract infection (RTI) patients were found to be Providencia rettgeri, results of the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of 31 antibiotics tested showed that all 100% for Providencia genus strains were resistance to minimum one antimicrobial of three class of antibiotics. The high frequent of resistance was nitrofurantoin (n=18, 100%), followed by ampicillin (n=17, 94.4), azithromycin (n = 16, 88.9%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (n = 13, 72.2%), cephalexin (n=8, 44.4%), ampicillin/ sulbactam(n=7, 38.8%), tetracycline and tigecycline (n=6, 33.3%). Resistance to nalidixic acid was found at rate of 16.7%, and at rate of 11.1% for each of the cefuroxime, trimethoprim and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. However, the percentages of resistance to imipenem and cefotaxime were 5.6% each one. Difference between the rates of resistance of CLFI and EUCAST for year 2017 of Providenciaspecies were significant (P < 0.01). MDR occurred in 11 strains (61.1%) and 9 strains (50%) of Providencia species depended on EUCAST and CLFI for year 2017, respectively. Furthermore, P. rettgeri exhibits a MDR phenotype were 25% and 12.5%, while P. alcalifaciens were 90% and 80% according to the EUCAST and CLSI for year 2017, respectively. Phenotypic tests of {\^{a}}-Lactamases production showed that all Providencia spp. strains (100%) gave positive results with this tests. Phenotypic tests revealed that ESBL, AmpC and MBL production were recognized in 66.7%, 37.5% and 80% of the Providencia spp., respectively. Coexistence of a ESBL with other types of {\^{a}}-Lactamases (MBL) were documented in 4(22.2%) strains. Moreover, the vast majority of Providencia strains producing {\^{a}}-Lactamases and exhibits a MDR phenotypic were observed in 8(100%) strains in wastewater.},

In this context, cultivable and molecular approaches were performed to assess the dissemination of bacteria and the antibiotic resistance genes in aquatic environment in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Cultivable approach quantified $\beta$-lactam, carbapenem resistant, and total Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae in river sediments and surface waters that receive raw hospital effluents. The molecular approach utilized Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) to quantify the total bacteria and the richness of relevant bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs: blaOXA-48, blaCTX-M, blaIMP, blaTEM) in sediment samples. Statistical analysis were employed to highlight the significance of hospital contribution and seasonal variation of bacteria and ARGs into aquatic ecosystems in suburban municipalities of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The contribution of hospitals to antibiotic resistance proliferation is higher in the dry season than during the wet season (p < 0.05). Hospital similarly contributed Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas and ARGs significantly to the sediments in both seasons (p < 0.05). The organic matter content correlated positively with E. coli (r = 0.50, p < 0.05). The total bacterial load correlated with Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas (0.49 < r < 0.69, p < 0.05). Each ARG correlated with the total bacterial load or at least one relevant bacteria (0.41 < r < 0.81, p < 0.05). Our findings confirm that hospital wastewaters contributed significantly to antibiotic resistance profile and the significance of this contribution increased in the dry season. Moreover, our analysis highlights this risk from untreated hospital wastewaters in developing countries, which presents a great threat to public health.},

abstract = {Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria pose a severe health risk globally. This study focused on detecting ESBL genes in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from a recreational water source and the waste water from a tertiary hospital in Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria. The isolates (twenty-two) were screened phenotypically for extended spectrum beta lactamase production using the double disk synergy test. Of the isolates, 13 (59.1%) were E. coli, while 9 (40.9%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae; 17 (77.3%) were isolated from the waste water and 5 (22.7%) were isolated from the recreational water. Six (27.2%) of them showed ESBL production phenotypically; however, PCR amplification of the ESBL genes showed that only five of them had at least one of the genes. The presence of ESBL bacteria in hospital waste water and surface waters highlights that water matrices are important routes of transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria. {\textcopyright} 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract = {Environmental fate of 58 pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) grouped into 11 therapeutic classes in the three different waters, hospital effluent, sewage treatment plant (STP) and river water, was estimated by combination of their quantitative concentration analysis and evaluation of their extent of contribution as loading sources. At the same time, distribution of six classes of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (AMRB) in the same water samples was estimated by screening of individual PhC-resistant microbes grown on each specific chromogenic medium. The results indicate that 48 PhCs were detected ranged from 1 ng/L (losartan carboxylic acid) to 228 $\mu$g/L (acetaminophen sulfate) in hospital effluent, and contribution of the pollution load derived from hospital effluent to STP influent was estimated as 0.1% to 15%. On the other hand, contribution of STP effluent to river water was high, 32% to 60% for antibacterials, antipertensives and X-ray contrast media. In the cases for AMRB, detected numbers of colonies of AMRB in hospital effluent ranged from 29 CFU/mL to 1805 CFU/mL, and the estimated contribution of the AMRB pollution load derived from hospital effluent to STP influent was as low as 0.1% (levofloxacin and olmesartan) to 5.1% (N-desmethyl tamoxifen). Although the contribution of STPs as loading sources of PhCs and AMRB in surface waters was large, ozonation as an advanced water treatment system effectively removed a wide range of both PhCs and AMRB in water samples. These results suggest the importance of reducing environmental pollutant loads (not only at STPs but also at medical facilities) before being discharged into the surface waters, to both conserve water and keep the water environment safe. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show the distribution and contribution of AMRB from hospital effluent to the surface waters.},

Hospitals treat critical bacterial infections and thus can serve as reservoirs of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria. Hence, this study was conducted to gauge the prevalence patterns of MDR bacteria in hospital wastewater. Water samples collected from 11 hospitals and 4 environmental sources belonging to 5 most-densely populated districts of West Bengal, India were grown on MacConkey and Eosin Methylene Blue agar. A total of 84 (hospital-associated = 70, environmental water sources = 14) isolates were characterized. The predominant species found in water from hospital-associated areas (HAA) were Acinetobacter baumannii (22.9%), Escherichia coli (28.6 %), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (25.7%). Greater than 75% of the HAA isolates were found to be mcr-1 gene negative and colistinresistant. Meropenem non-susceptibility was also high among the HAA isolates at 58.6%, with the presence of the carbapenemase gene and blaNDM in 67.1% of the non-susceptible isolates. Among the three predominant species, significantly higher numbers of E. coli isolates were found to be non-susceptible to meropenem ((80%), p-value = 0.00432) and amikacin (AK (90%), p-value = 0.00037). This study provides evidence for the presence of high numbers of colistin-resistant and carbapenem-hydrolyzing Proteobacteriain hospital wastewater.},

There is scarcity of EHEC O157:H7 data in South Africa. This study was carried out to determine the molecular characteristics and genotypic diversity of EHEC O157:H7 isolates in the Gauteng region, South Africa. Samples were cultured on selective chromogenic media. Antibiotic susceptibility profile of isolates was determined using the VITEK{\textregistered}-2 automated system. Isolates were characterised using multiplex PCR assays and the genetic diversity was determined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). A total of 520 samples of which 270 environmental water samples and 250 stool specimens were collected and analysed. Overall, EHEC O157:H7 was recovered from 2.3% (12/520) of samples collected. Environmental water samples and clinical stool specimens showed a prevalence of 4.07% (11/270) and 0.4% (1/250) respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility profile varied from isolates with full susceptibility to isolates with resistance to multiple antibiotics. Most resistance was detected to the penicillins, specifically ampicillin (7/12), amoxicillin (3/12) and piperacillin/Tazobactam (3/12) followed by one of the folate inhibitors, trimethoprim (3/12) and the carbapenems, imipenem and meropenem (2/12) each. Three isolates harboured a combination of Shiga-toxins (Stx)-2, intimin (eae) and enterohaemolysin (hlyA) genes, while two isolates harboured the Stx-1, Stx-2 and hlyA genes. The PFGE performed showed that EHEC O157:H7 isolates were genetically diverse, with two minor pulsotypes and eight singletons. The MLST analysis identified three sequence types (STs) (ST10, ST11 and ST1204) that have been previously reported associated with outbreaks. The STs identified in this study pose a potential public health risk to consumers of untreated environmental water and closed human contacts. There is necessity to enhance surveillance in reducing the propagation of this bacterium which is a public health problem. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{20203279810,
abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing public health concern. Recent research has suggested that interactions between pathogens and antibiotic residues in various environmental matrices promote the development and spread of AMR in the environment. The levels of antibiotic residues in the aquatic environment have been analysed globally. Recently, Predicted No Effect Environmental Concentration (PNEC) values for many antibiotics have been suggested, based on their estimated minimal selective concentrations for selected bacterial species. The PNEC values can serve as a guide on the maximum levels of antibiotic residues in an environmental matrix, below which resistance is unlikely to develop. Aim: We aimed to determine which of the antibiotics, considered as “priority antibiotics” by the World Health Organisation (WHO), most frequently exceeded their PNEC values in the global aquatic environment. Methods: We obtained data from the German Environment Agency pharmaceutical database on means, medians or single values of 12 antibiotic types in five different environmental matrices [municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent, industrial wastewater effluent, hospital wastewater effluent, surface water, and drinking water] across 47 countries. We compared the mean levels of the 12 antibiotics in each environmental matrix to their suggested PNEC values to determine which antibiotic types exceeded PNEC and were most likely to select for resistance. We also determined which environmental matrices and countries had the highest burden of antibiotic residues. Results: Our study revealed that 7.9% of all analyses of antibiotic residues performed in the environmental matrices globally exceeded PNEC. Ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin had the greatest proportion (>30%) of residues exceeding PNEC. Hospital wastewater and industrial wastewater had the highest burden of antibiotic residues exceeding PNEC. No antibiotics exceeded PNEC in drinking water. Conclusion: While most environmental monitoring studies have focused on municipal wastewater treatment plants, the limited number of studies on hospital wastewater and industrial wastewater revealed that a large number of antibiotic residues coming from these sources exceeded their PNEC values. Our study highlights the importance of implementing on-site treatment systems that aim to destroy antibiotics prior to discharging wastewater to surface waters. Attention needs to be focused on the role that environmental matrices, particularly our wastewater sites, play in promoting antibiotic resistance. Novel treatment technologies need to be developed and implemented to increase the removal efficiencies of treatment plants and from antibiotic manufacturing, and decrease the discharge of antibiotic residues into aquatic environments.},

abstract = {Effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been proposed to act as point sources of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Hospital sewage may contribute to the spread of ARB and ARGs as it contains the feces and urine of hospitalized patients, who are more frequently colonized with multi-drug resistant bacteria than the general population. However, whether hospital sewage noticeably contributes to the quantity and diversity of ARGs in the general sewerage system has not yet been determined. Here, we employed culture-independent techniques, namely 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nanolitre-scale quantitative PCRs, to assess the role of hospital effluent as a point source of ARGs in the sewerage system, through comparing microbiota composition and levels of ARGs in hospital sewage with WWTP influent with and without hospital sewage. Compared to other sites, hospital sewage was richest in human-associated bacteria and contained the highest relative levels of ARGs. Yet, the relative abundance of ARGs was comparable in the influent of WWTPs with and without hospital sewage, suggesting that hospitals do not contribute importantly to the quantity and diversity of ARGs in the investigated sewerage system.},

Microorganisms can relatively promptly adapt to evolutionary pressures of the environment, including antibiotics.

Wastewater samples had been taken from effluent of hospitals and from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Petr{\v{z}}alka influent and effluent. In these samples, presence of 38 substances was monitored. The highest concentration was observed in case of tramadol, citalopram, venlafaxine, cotinine, atenolol, valsartan, carbamazepine, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin. According to this data, we focused also on individual pharmaceutical compounds presented in wastewater samples in elevated concentrations. Effect on resistance development of two pain relief medications (carbamazepine, tramadol), hypotensive medications (atenolol, valsartan), and the nicotine metabolite (cotinine) was also investigated. For this study, we employed concentrations presented in wastewater as well as in urine of patients and/or users. To determine the frequency of mutations leading to ciprofloxacin resistance, we applied the modified Ames test employing the strain Salmonella Typhimurium. Resistance index increased in the case of all wastewater samples from conventional hospitals where we observed a 1.22–1.69-fold increase of mutations leading to ciprofloxacin resistance. Tested compounds caused rise of resistance index in lower concentrations found in wastewater. The most significant increase of resistance index was detected after carbamazepine treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: New antibiotic resistance determinants are generally discovered too  late, long after they have irreversibly emerged in pathogens and spread widely. Early discovery of resistance genes, before or soon after their transfer to pathogens could allow more effective measures to monitor and reduce spread, and facilitate genetics-based diagnostics. RESULTS: We modified a functional metagenomics approach followed by in silico filtering of known resistance genes to discover novel, mobilised resistance genes in class 1 integrons in wastewater-impacted environments. We identified an integron-borne gene cassette encoding a protein that conveys high-level resistance against aminoglycosides with a garosamine moiety when expressed in E. coli. The gene is named gar (garosamine-specific aminoglycoside resistance) after its specificity. It contains none of the functional domains of known aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, but bears characteristics of a kinase. By searching public databases, we found that the gene occurs in three sequenced, multi-resistant clinical isolates (two Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one Luteimonas sp.) from Italy and China, respectively, as well as in two food-borne Salmonella enterica isolates from the USA. In all cases, gar has escaped discovery until now. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a novel resistance gene, present in clinical isolates, has been discovered by exploring the environmental microbiome. The gar gene has spread horizontally to different species on at least three continents, further limiting treatment options for bacterial infections. Its specificity to garosamine-containing aminoglycosides may reduce the usefulness of the newest semisynthetic aminoglycoside plazomicin, which is designed to avoid common aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms. Since the gene appears to be not yet common in the clinics, the data presented here enables early surveillance and maybe even mitigation of its spread.},

Resistance rates to all antibiotics were markedly higher in hospital sewage than in other samples.

abstract = {Aim: The current study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial resistance profile and genetic relatedness of Aeromonas sp. isolated from healthcare and urban effluents, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and river water. Methods and Results: We detected the presence of genes conferring resistance to $\beta$-lactam, quinolone and aminoglycoside. Multilocus sequence typing was carried out to differentiate the strains, and multilocus phylogenetic analysis was used to identify the species. A total of 28 cefotaxime-resistant Aeromonas sp. strains were identified, harbouring uncommon Guiana-extended-spectrum (GES)-type $\beta$-lactamases (GES-1, GES-5, GES-7 and GES-16). Multidrug-resistant Aeromonas sp. were found in hospital wastewater, WWTP and sanitary effluent, and A. caviae was identified as the most prevalent species (85{\textperiodcentered}7%). Conclusion: The release of untreated healthcare effluents, presence of antimicrobials in the environment, in addition to multidrug-resistant Aeromonas sp., are all potential factors for the spread of resistance. Significance and Impact of the Study: We identified a vast repertoire of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) in Aeromonas sp. from diverse aquatic ecosystems, including those that encode enzymes degrading broad-spectrum antimicrobials widely used to treat healthcare-associated infections. Hospital and sanitary effluents serve as potential sources of bacteria harbouring ARG and are a threat to public health.},

However, little is known regarding the pool of ARGs in extracellular DNA (eDNA). In this study ten ARGs (sul1, sul2, tetW, tetX, ermA, ermB, blaTEM, ampC, cat and cmr) and class I integron (intI1) in the sludge from hospital, pharmaceutical industry, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and swine manure, and sediment in urban lake in the form of both eDNA and intracellular DNA (iDNA) were evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The results showed that every gram of sludge dry weight contained from 7.31 × 103 to 1.16 × 1010 copies of extracellular ARGs (eARGs) and from 1.04 × 105 to 2.74 × 1012 copies of intracellular ARGs (iARGs). The sludge from hospital with the highest ratio of eARGs to total ARGs (11.02–89.63%), followed by the sediment from urban lake, implying that most of the ARGs in these regions were contributed by eARGs. The relative abundance of eARGs were higher than iARGs in sludge from WWTP and pharmaceutical industry, moreover, 1/3 and 5/9 detected eARGs were higher than the ARGs in the iDNA extracted from sludge of hospital and sediment from urban lake, respectively. Furthermore, the transforming ability of eARGs suggesting that adsorbed eARG is more preferentially coupled to the competent cells than free eARG. These findings highlight the need to focus attention on the contribution of eARGs to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance into environment, and also future needs in mitigating the spread of eARGs in the environment.},

Methodology: The identities of isolates were confirmed with 16S rRNA gene sequence and MALDI-TOF analysis. Anti-mi-crobial resistance, biofilm production and clonal diversity were also evaluated. The minimum inhibitory concentration technique as described by Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute: CLSI Guidelines (CLSI) was employed for the evaluation of isolate susceptibility to antibiotics. Result: Forty-five Stenotrophomonas species which include 36 environmental strains and 9 clinical strains of S. maltophilia were considered in this study. 32 (88.9 %) environmental strains were identified to be S. maltophilia, 2 (5.6 %) were Stenotrophomonas nitritireducens, and 2 (5.6 %) cluster as Stenotrophomonas spp. Stenotrophomonas isolates were resistant to at least six of the antibiotics tested, including Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (SXT). Conclusion: Environmental isolates from this study were resistant to SXT which is commonly used for the treatment of S. maltophilia infections. This informs the need for good public hygiene as the environment could be a reservoir of multi-resistant bacteria. It also buttresses the importance of surveillance study in the management of bacterial resistance.},

abstract = {The incidence of antibiotic-resistant fecal coliforms in raw and treated hospital and municipal wastes was investigated to determine whether such wastes may serve as reservoirs for the spread of resistant bacteria and resistance transfer factors. Multiple resistance occurred in 87.8% of isolates from hospital and 42.6% of isolates from municipal wastes. Antibiotic resistance was transferable to Escherichia coli and Salmonella cholerae-suis recipient strains from 62.3% of resistant isolates from hospital and 90.9% of resistant isolates from municipal wastes, and from 56.2% of all isolates from hospital and 45.9% of all isolates from municipal wastes. Numbers of multiply-resistant fecal coliforms decreased during passage through a sewage treatment plant, but their proportion did not change appreciably, although proportions exhibiting resistance to 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 drugs decreased. A study of transfer in sewage indicated that transfer of resistance from donors present in sewage to pathogenic Salmonella strains can occur under appropriate conditions. The data suggest that both raw and treated wastes, and especially those from hospitals, may serve as reservoirs for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and transferable resistance in the environment.},

abstract = {Quinolones are one of the most important classes of antibacterials available for the treatment of infectious diseases in humans. However, there is a growing concern about bacterial resistance to antimicrobials including quinolones. The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the aquatic environment has been recognized as a growing threat to public health and hospitals appear to be a major contributor to this. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of quinolone resistance in Escherichia coli from selected water bodies receiving direct hospital effluents in Kerala, India. Standard disc diffusion and E-test were used for antibiotic susceptibility testing. As antibiotic resistance can develop in bacterial isolates by different means, EtBr Agar Cartwheel method was used to detect the efflux pump activity and presence of resistant genes was detected by PCR. The mechanism of transfer of plasmid mediated resistance was confirmed by conjugation experiments. A total of 209 multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli were isolated from different hospital effluent discharge sites and aquaculture farms located in their vicinity. Among them, qnrB was found to be most prevalent followed by qnrS, OqxAB, qnrA and aac (6′)-Ib-cr. The results suggested that the antibiotics present at sub-inhibitory concentrations in direct hospital effluents increases the selection pressure impacting the cell function of even normal microorganisms in the aquatic environment to change the genetic expression of virulence factors or acquire resistance genes by different transfer mechanisms, posing a serious threat to public health.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives: The antibiotic resistance among Enterococcus faecium strains has increased worldwide. Additionally, biofilm-forming isolates of E. faecium play an important role in human infections. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes between biofilm-producing and non-biofilm-producing E. faecium strains. Materials and Methods: In this study, 228 E. faecium isolates from clinical and environmental specimens were obtained from different wards of hospitals in Lorestan province (Iran). Then, the pattern of antibiotic resistance and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against beta-lactams, glycopeptides, aminoglycosides and other common antibiotics was investigated using disk diffusion and agar dilution methods. Biofilm formation was investigated using polystyrene microtiter plates. PCR assay was conducted for antibiotic resistance and biofilm related genes. Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to determine the clonal spread of isolates. Results: Most of isolates (78%) were resistant to penicillin, but all were susceptible to linezolid and tigecycline. The biofilm-producing isolates were more resistant to beta-lactams, glycopeptides and aminoglycosides compared to non-biofilm-producing strains. In biofilm-producing isolates, pilA, pilB, efaAfm and esp were the dominant virulence genes and vanA and pbp5 genes were the dominant resistant genes. PFGE analysis exhibited a similar pattern between the clinical and environmental isolates, suggesting the presence of a common origin of the infection by E. faecium. Conclusion: The results of the antibiotic resistance, biofilm assay, and PFGE analysis suggest that there is a common clone of persistent and biofilm-producing strains of E. faecium, which could rapidly disseminate in patients and the environment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The interconnectivities of built and natural environments can serve as  conduits for the proliferation and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Several studies have compared the broad spectrum of ARGs (i.e., "resistomes") in various environmental compartments, but there is a need to identify unique ARG occurrence patterns (i.e., "discriminatory ARGs"), characteristic of each environment. Such an approach will help to identify factors influencing ARG proliferation, facilitate development of relative comparisons of the ARGs distinguishing various environments, and help pave the way towards ranking environments based on their likelihood of contributing to the spread of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance. Here we formulate and demonstrate an approach using an extremely randomized tree (ERT) algorithm combined with a Bayesian optimization technique to capture ARG variability in environmental samples and identify the discriminatory ARGs. The potential of ERT for identifying discriminatory ARGs was first evaluated using in silico metagenomic datasets (simulated metagenomic Illumina sequencing data) with known variability. The application of ERT was then demonstrated through analyses using publicly available and in-house metagenomic datasets associated with (1) different aquatic habitats (e.g., river, wastewater influent, hospital effluent, and dairy farm effluent) to compare resistomes between distinct environments and (2) different river samples (i.e., Amazon, Kalamas, and Cam Rivers) to compare resistome characteristics of similar environments. RESULTS: The approach was found to readily identify discriminatory ARGs in the in silico datasets. Also, it was not found to be biased towards ARGs with high relative abundance, which is a common limitation of feature projection methods, and instead only captured those ARGs that elicited significant profiles. Analyses of publicly available metagenomic datasets further demonstrated that the ERT approach can effectively differentiate real-world environmental samples and identify discriminatory ARGs based on pre-defined categorizing schemes. CONCLUSIONS: Here a new methodology was formulated to characterize and compare variances in ARG profiles between metagenomic data sets derived from similar/dissimilar environments. Specifically, identification of discriminatory ARGs among samples representing various environments can be identified based on factors of interest. The methodology could prove to be a particularly useful tool for ARG surveillance and the assessment of the effectiveness of strategies for mitigating the spread of antibiotic resistance.

For comparison of both methods, knowledge of their correlation is necessary. Therefore the population of total bacteria, Escherichia coli, enterococci and staphylococci during sewage treatment and in receiving river water was compared by agar plating and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. In parallel, all samples were investigated for clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes. Whereas plating and qPCR data for total bacteria correlated well in sewage after primary treatment, qPCR data of river water indicated higher cell numbers for E. coli. It is unknown if these cells are 'only' not growing under standard conditions or if they are dead. Corresponding to the amount of non-culturable cells, the 'breakpoints' for monitoring water quality should be adapted. The abundances of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes in river water were in the same order of magnitude or even higher than in treated sewage. For estimation of the health risk it is important to investigate which species carry respective genes and whether these genes are disseminated via gene transfer.},

abstract = {Airplane sanitary facilities are shared by an international audience. We hypothesized the corresponding sewage to be an extraordinary source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and resistance genes (ARG) in terms of diversity and quantity. Accordingly, we analyzed ARG and ARB in airplane-borne sewage using complementary approaches: metagenomics, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and cultivation. For the purpose of comparison, we also quantified ARG and ARB in the inlets of municipal treatment plants with and without connection to airports. As expected, airplane sewage contained an extraordinarily rich set of mobile ARG, and the relative abundances of genes were mostly increased compared to typical raw sewage of municipal origin. Moreover, combined resistance against third-generation cephalosporins, fluorochinolones, and aminoglycosides was unusually common (28.9%) among Escherichia coli isolated from airplane sewage. This percentage exceeds the one reported for German clinical isolates by a factor of 8. Our findings suggest that airplane-borne sewage can effectively contribute to the fast and global spread of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {Water bodies worldwide have proven to be vast reservoirs of clinically significant antibiotic resistant organisms. Contamination of waters by anthropogenic discharges is a significant contributor to the widespread dissemination of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this research was to investigate multiple different anthropogenic sources on a national scale for the role they play in the environmental propagation of antibiotic resistance. A total of 39 water and 25 sewage samples were collected across four local authority areas in the West, East and South of Ireland. In total, 211 Enterobacterales were isolated (139 water, 72 sewage) and characterised. A subset of isolates (n=60) were chosen for whole genome sequencing. Direct comparisons of the water versus sewage isolate collections revealed a higher percentage of sewage isolates displayed resistance to cefoxitin (46%) and ertapenem (32%), while a higher percentage of water isolates displayed resistance to tetracycline (55%) and ciprofloxacin (71%). Half of all isolates displayed extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production phenotypically (n = 105/211; 50%), with blaCTX-M detected in 99/105 isolates by PCR. Carbapenemase genes were identified in 11 isolates (6 sewage, 5 water). The most common variant was blaOXA-48 (n=6), followed by blaNDM-5 (n=2) and blaKPC-2 (n=2). Whole genome sequencing analysis revealed numerous different sequence types in circulation in both waters and sewage including E. coli ST131 (n=15), ST38 (n=8), ST10 (n=4) along with Klebsiella ST405 (n=3) and ST11 (n=2). Core genome MLST (cgMLST) comparisons uncovered three highly similar Klebsiella isolates originating from hospital sewage and two nearby waters. The Klebsiella isolates from an estuary and seawater displayed 99.1% and 98.8% cgMLST identity to the hospital sewage isolate respectively. In addition, three pairs of E. coli isolates from different waters also revealed cgMLST similarities, indicating widespread dissemination and persistence of certain strains in the aquatic environment. These findings highlight the need for routine monitoring of water bodies used for recreational and drinking purposes for the presence of multi-drug resistant organisms.},

abstract = {Extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) are excreted via effluents and sewage into the environment where they can re-contaminate humans and animals. The aim of this observational study was to detect and quantify ESBL-EC in recreational water and wastewater, and perform a genetic and phenotypic comparative analysis of the environmental strains with geographically associated human urinary ESBL-EC. Recreational fresh- and saltwater samples from four different beaches and wastewater samples from a nearby sewage plant were filtered and cultured on differential and ESBL-selective media. After antimicrobial susceptibility testing and multi-locus variable number of tandem repeats assay (MLVA), selected ESBL-EC strains from recreational water were characterized by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and compared to wastewater and human urine isolates from people living in the same area. We detected ESBL-EC in recreational water samples on 8/20 occasions (40%), representing all sites. The ratio of ESBL-EC to total number of E. coli colony forming units varied from 0 to 3.8%. ESBL-EC were present in all wastewater samples in ratios of 0.56–0.75%. ST131 was most prevalent in urine and wastewater samples, while ST10 dominated in water samples. Eight STs and identical ESBL-EC MLVA-types were detected in all compartments. Clinical ESBL-EC isolates were more likely to be multidrug-resistant (p<0.001). This study confirms that ESBL-EC, including those that are capable of causing human infection, are present in recreational waters where there is a potential for human exposure and subsequent gut colonisation and infection in bathers. Multidrug-resistant E. coli strains are present in urban aquatic environments even in countries where antibiotic consumption in both humans and animals is highly restricted.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance surveillance through regional and up-to-date testing of  clinical isolates is a foundation for implementing effective empirical treatment. Surveillance data also provides an overview of geographical and temporal changes that are invaluable for guiding interventions. Still, due to limited infrastructure and resources, clinical surveillance data is lacking in many parts of the world. Given that sewage is largely made up of human fecal bacteria from many people, sewage epidemiology could provide a cost-efficient strategy to partly fill the current gap in clinical surveillance of antibiotic resistance. Here we explored the potential of sewage metagenomic data to assess clinical antibiotic resistance prevalence using environmental and clinical surveillance data from across the world. The sewage resistome correlated to clinical surveillance data of invasive Escherichia coli isolates, but none of several tested approaches provided a sufficient resolution for clear discrimination between resistance towards different classes of antibiotics. However, in combination with socioeconomic data, the overall clinical resistance situation could be predicted with good precision. We conclude that analyses of bacterial genes in sewage could contribute to informing management of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {Hospital effluents are crucial hotspots for the dissemination of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. This study analysed hospital effluent and proximate wastewater treatment plants for the presence of antibiotic resistant Klebsiella spp. Water samples were obtained twice over a three-month period from an urban and rural hospital at three effluent points each, and from two proximate wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) comprising influent and effluent and river water samples up/downstream the WWTPs. Presumptive Klebsiella spp. were enumerated, isolated, and phenotypically confirmed using a well-established commercial test system for Enterobacteriaceae (API20E). Clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were provided by a hospital for comparison. The antibiotic resistance profiles of Klebsiella spp. isolates to 16 selected antibiotics were established according to EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing). In addition, extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase production was analysed. A total of 93 confirmed Klebsiella spp. isolates from hospital effluents and 37 from WWTPs were obtained, comprising K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca. The viable counts for confirmed Klebsiella spp. for hospital effluents ranged from 1.38 × 102 to 1.03 × 104, while those for WWTP influent were in a range of 1.76 × 103 to 5.10 × 103 CFU/ml. A higher proportion of Klebsiella spp. from urban hospital effluent was categorized as multidrug-resistant (MDR) (23%) compared to rural hospital effluent (9%). Resistance was observed to all antibiotic classes tested. Several clinical isolates presented resistance to four carbapenem antibiotics, while certain isolates from hospital effluent and WWTPs exhibited ertapenem and doripenem resistance. Fifteen Klebsiella spp. isolates (clinical and from urban hospital effluent) produced carbapenemases. Hospital effluents in South Africa contain antibiotic resistant Klebsiella spp. and may pose a risk to proximate informal communities if inadequately treated. Moreover, common phenotypic resistance profiles among isolates from the clinical-hospital effluent-wastewater works continuum suggest a need for further treatment of such effluent.},

abstract = {In two sets of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas bacteria resistant to at least  two antibiotics a distinctly upward trend was found in the incidence of strains resistant to gentamicin. The strains examined were either routine isolates from three municipal wastewater treatment facilities or from the Danube river samples collected near the outlet of municipal sewerage. The resistance to gentamicin points to the representation of strains originating from hospitalized patients and its incidence among wastewater strains is recordable since the summer of 1981. Gentamicin resistance transfer could be demonstrated in a sewage sludge strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to seven antibiotics and in two multiresistant isolates from the river Danube. Resistance transfers in the case of other antibiotics, especially those susceptible to beta-lactamase (ampicillin, carbenicillin), were demonstrated in 10 out of the 24 di- and multiresistant strains tested. These findings show that both municipal wastewater and water in streams may function as the reservoirs of strains bearing the determinants of transferable resistance. Such strains may play an important role not only in the ecology and epidemiology of R plasmids, but also in the accidental spread of the so-called DNA recombinants that might escape during gene manipulations.},

abstract = {Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are being debated for being the hot spots for the development of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic microbial communities. We observed the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), antibiotic resistance genes (ARG), and multidrug resistance (MDR) in two municipal WWTPs and one hospital WWTP in Western and Southern Sri Lanka, and compared the results with particular reference to Indian and the World scenario to trace the imprints of treatment on ARB and ARG. Result suggests that although wastewater treatment resulted in higher than 1.06 log Escherichia coli (E. coli) reduction at all WWTPs, yet the percent of E. coli resistant to most of the antibiotics increased from influent to effluent. Higher prevalence of ARB, ARG, and MDR were noted in hospital WWTP owing to the higher antibiotic concentrations used and excreted by the patients. With reference to India, the WWTPs in Sri Lanka showed more ARB and a consistent increase in its percentages after the treatment but were less resistant to Fluoroquinolone (FQ). E. coli strains isolated from each location of both countries showed multidrug resistance, which has increased after the treatment and was strongly correlated with FQ in every WWTP. Resistant genes for Fluoroquinolone (FQ) (aac-(6′)-1b-cr, qnrB, qnrS), $\beta$-lactams (ampC), and sulphonamides (sul1) were common in all the wastewaters except additional parC gene in the hospital effluent of Sri Lanka, implying much higher resistance for quinolones, especially for Ciprofloxacin. Multivariate statistical treatments suggest that effluent showed higher loadings and association for MDR/ARB, where pH change and more extensive interaction with metals during the treatment processes seem to have profound effects.},

abstract = {The pollution of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has been highlighted on a global scale because of their serious threats to the environment and human health. Typical urban water in cities with high population density are ideal mediums for the acquisition and spread of antibiotics and ARGs. The pollution level of a broad range of antibiotics and ARGs in hospital wastewater, groundwater and the Wenyu River, and their fates through three sewage treatment plants (STPs) were investigated in this study. The concentrations of the 11 detected antibiotics ranged from not detected (ND)-16800 ng L−1 in diverse water samples from Beijing, and fluoroquinolones were detected at the highest concentration, especially in the hospital samples. The maximum concentrations of antibiotics in STPs and hospital were 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than those in the surface water from Wenyu River and groundwater. Good removal efficiencies by treatment processes were observed for tetracyclines and quinolones, and low removal efficiencies were observed for sulfonamides and macrolides. These results also revealed that the sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1, sul2) and macrolide resistance genes (ermB) were detected at the highest relative abundances (7.11 × 10−2-1.18 × 10−1) in the water bodies of Beijing. It was worth noting that sul1 abundance was the highest in groundwater samples. The relative abundance of most ARGs in STPs exhibited a declining trend in the order of influent > secondary effluents > effluent. However, the relative abundance of sul 1, sul 2 and tetC in the effluent was higher than those in the influent. The incomplete removal of antibiotics and ARGs in STPs poses a serious threat to the receiving rivers, and affects ecosystem security. Overall, our findings provide favorable support for a further investigation of the spread and risk of antibiotics and ARGs from diverse sources (e.g., STPs and hospitals) to the aquatic environment.},

abstract = {Background. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a human, animal, and environmental commensal and a leading cause of nosocomial infections, which are often caused by multiresistant strains. We evaluate putative sources of K. pneumoniae that are carried by and infect hospital patients. Methods. We conducted a 6-month survey on 2 hematology wards at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom, in 2015 to isolate K. pneumoniae from stool, blood, and the environment. We conducted cross-sectional surveys of K. pneumoniae from 29 livestock farms, 97 meat products, the hospital sewer, and 20 municipal wastewater treatment plants in the East of England between 2014 and 2015. Isolates were sequenced and their genomes compared. Results. Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from stool of 17/149 (11%) patients and 18/922 swabs of their environment, together with 1 bloodstream infection during the study and 4 others over a 24-month period. Each patient carried 1 or more lineages that was unique to them, but 2 broad environmental contamination events and patient-environment transmission were identified. Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from cattle, poultry, hospital sewage, and 12/20 wastewater treatment plants. There was low genetic relatedness between isolates from patients/their hospital environment vs isolates from elsewhere. Identical genes encoding cephalosporin resistance were carried by isolates from humans/environment and elsewhere but were carried on different plasmids. Conclusion. We identified no patient-to-patient transmission and no evidence for livestock as a source of K. pneumoniae infecting humans.

abstract = {This study investigated the resistance profiles of Gram-negative strains isolated from different types of wastewater and the receiving river. Significantly higher resistance rates were observed in strains from river receiving wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent as compared with strains from upstream river. High multidrug resistance rates were registered in E. coli (60.34%), Enterobacter (34.38%) and Klebsiella (32.76%) strains. Strains isolated from river receiving WWTP effluent harboured blaCMY, blaNDM, tetD, sulI and qnrB genes. The blaTEM, blaSHV and blaCMY genes were detected in 10% to 40% of wastewater strains. The tetB was the most frequent in WWTP effluent (75%), WWTP influent (42.85%) and hospital effluent (33.33%). The sulI gene was the most common (20-56.25%) in all wastewater types, followed by sulII (9.09-16.66%). The qnrB (60%) and qnrS (33.33%) genes were detected in strains isolated from hospital effluent. The results of this study showed that wastewater treatment process might increase the antibiotic resistance of WWTP bacteria. The bacterial strains isolated from the WWTP effluent exhibited about 50% of the 18 investigated resistance genes, which could be further disseminated among environmental bacteria.},

abstract = {Background: The use of antimicrobials and myeloablative chemotherapy regimens has promoted multiresistant microorganisms to emerge as nosocomial pathogens, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm). We described a polyclonal outbreak of bloodstream infection caused by Efm in a hemato-oncological ward in Mexico. Our aim was to describe the clonal complex (CC) of the Efm strains isolated in the outbreak in comparison with commensal and environmental isolates. Methodology: Sixty Efm clinical, environmental, and commensal strains were included. We constructed a cladogram and a phylogenetic tree using Vitek and Multilocus sequence typing data, respectively. Results: We reported 20 new sequence types (ST), among which 17/43 clinical isolates belonged to CC17. The predominant ST in the clinical strains were ST757, ST1304, ST412, and ST770. Neither environmental nor commensal isolates belonged to CC17. The phylogeny of our collection shows that the majority of the clinical isolates were different from the environmental and commensal isolates, and only a small group of clinical isolates was closely related with environmental and commensal isolates. The cladogram revealed a similar segregation to that of the phylogeny. Conclusions: We found a high diversity among clinical, environmental, and commensal strains in a group of samples in a single hospital. Highest diversity was found between commensal and environmental isolates. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.},

abstract = {Sewer systems are reservoirs of pathogens and bacteria carrying antibiotic  resistance genes (ARGs). However, most recent high-throughput studies rely on DNA-based techniques that cannot provide information on the physiological state of the cells nor expression of ARGs. In this study, wastewater and sewer sediment samples were collected from combined and separate sanitary sewer systems. The metabolically active prokaryote community was evaluated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and actively transcribed ARG abundance was measured using mRNA RT-qPCR. Three (sul1, bla(TEM), tet(G)) of the eight tested ARGs were quantifiable in select samples. Sewer sediment samples had greater abundance of actively transcribed ARGs compared to wastewater. Microbiome analysis showed the presence of metabolically active family taxa that contain clinically relevant pathogens (Pseudomonadaceae, Enterobacteraceae, Streptococcaceae, Arcobacteraceae, and Clostridiaceae) and corrosion-causing prokaryotes (Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae) in both matrices. Spirochaetaceae and methanogens were more common in the sediment matrix while Mycobacteraceae were more common in wastewater. The microbiome obtained from 16S rRNA sequencing had a significantly different structure from the 16S rRNA gene microbiome. Overall, this study demonstrates active transcription of ARGs in sewer systems and provides insight into the abundance and physiological state of taxa of interest in the different sewer matrices and sewer types relevant for wastewater-based epidemiology, corrosion, and understanding the hazard posed by different matrices during sewer overflows.},

abstract = {Background Acinetobacter baumannii is a leading emerging pathogen that is frequently recovered from patients during hospital outbreaks. The role of environmental A. baumannii reservoirs is therefore of great concern worldwide. Aim To investigate the connection between A. baumannii causing hospital outbreaks and environmental isolates from hospital wastewater, urban sewage and river water as the final natural recipient of wastewaters. Methods Clinical isolates from patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia and environmental isolates from water were collected during a two-month monitoring period. Recovery of A. baumannii was performed using CHROMagar Acinetobacter plates, incubated at 42°C for 48 h. Identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and analyses of rpoB gene. The antibiotic resistance profiles were interpreted according to criteria given for clinical isolates of A. baumannii. The sequence types (ST) were retrieved by multi-locus sequence typing. Results Fourteen of 19 isolates recovered from patients, hospital wastewaters, urban sewage and river water belonged to ST-195. The remaining five isolates recovered from patients and river water were assigned to ST-1421. All isolates showed very strong relatedness and clustered into CC92, which corresponds to IC2. All isolates were non-susceptible to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories, and thus were classified as ‘extensively-drug-resistant' (XDR). Heteroresistance to colistin was found in two isolates from hospital wastewater. Conclusion Close relatedness of clinical and environmental isolates suggests the emission of XDR A. baumannii via the untreated hospital wastewater in the natural environment.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of identification of Bacteroides fragilis group (BFG) strains isolated from human and rat feces, hospital wastewater, and untreated and treated sewage from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). BFG strains were plated on Bacteroides Bile Esculin (BBE) agar. Characteristic colonies were isolated from the culture medium, tested for antibiotic resistance and identified by PCR and MALDI-TOF MS. A total of 319 strains that formed characteristic colonies were isolated from BBE agar, of which 250 were resistant to kanamycin, colistin and vancomycin. PCR revealed that only 135 strains harbored the bfr gene specific to the BFG. In MALDI-TOF MS analysis, only 123 isolates were classified as members of the BFG. The most frequently isolated species was Parabacteroides distasonis (51.22% of strains). B. fragilis, B. ovatus and B. thetaiotaomicron were less frequently encountered in the analyzed environmental samples (30.01%, 8.13% and 5.69%, respectively). The strains isolated from human and rat feces on BBE agar were most reliably identified, and 100% of the isolated strains were classified as members of the BFG. The effectiveness of isolation of BFG strains from hospital wastewater and untreated and treated sewage from the WWTP was relatively low (20%, 19%, 40%, respectively). The results of this study suggest that the method for isolating BFG strains from environmental samples on BBE agar requires modification. Additional methods, such as PCR and MALDI-TOF MS, can be used to more effectively identify BFG strains isolated from different environmental samples. {\textcopyright} The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.},

abstract = {Objectives: Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many commonly
used antimicrobial agents. They are able to acquire resistance with
relative ease and can spread these genes to other species. Enterococci
resistant to antibiotics are associated with the use of these in
clinical practice and also the spread of resistant clones in the world.
The aim of this work was to compare the characteristics of the strains
of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolated from municipal
wastewater and hospital effluent.
Methods: Samples were obtained from the effluent of the Hospital
Universitario Jose de San Martin (Buenos Aires) and the municipal
wastewater of the city of Buenos Aires.
Results: The bacterial counts of VRE were greater in the hospital
effluent, with an odds ratio of 36.4 (95% CI: 26.0-50.8; p<0.0001). The
VRE isolated were mainly identified as E. faecium. The results indicate
a high prevalence of enterococci resistant to the antibiotics tested.
Conclusion: We may conclude that the effluents of hospitals constitute a
source of VRE showing multiple resistance to antibiotics.},

Of environmental concern is hospital effluents discharging into wastewaters. This article investigated the prevalence and detection of antibiotic resistance genes in Staphylococcus species from clinical and environmental sources in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Standard culture-based and molecular protocols were used. Seventy-six (27 clinical, 14 hospital effluent and 35 environmental) Staphylococcus isolates were recovered: 56.58% were coagulase-negative and 43.42% coagulase-positive (S. aureus). For the clinical isolates, 10, 6, 4, 4 and 1 were isolated from urine, skin, wounds, blood and pus, respectively. Isolates were resistant to methicillin and amoxycillin (91.7%), cloxacillin (88.0%), ciprofloxacin (84.0%), ofloxacin (83.3%), azithromycin (78.0%), ceftazidime (76.0%), gentamycin (75.0%), cefuroxime (75.0%) and erythromycin (72.0%). Nearly, all isolates (90.8%) had multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index >0.2. Overall MAR indices for Staphylococcus species isolated from the clinical, hospital effluent and environmental wastewaters were relatively similar (0.482; 0.500; 0.435). mecA, nuc and luk-pvl genes were detected in S. aureus, while mecA was detected in S. arlettae, S. sciuri, S. cohnii, S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus. This study informs on the potential contamination of environmental waters downstream from hospitals and possible impacts that this could have on human and animal health.},

Most studies have addressed the impact on the aquatic environment, as water is an important source of anthropogenic pollutants. Few investigations have been conducted on terrestrial animals living near treatment ponds. We isolated extendedspectrum- b-lactamase Enterobacter cloacae complex-producing strains from 35 clinical isolates, 29 samples of wastewater, 19 wild animals, and 10 domestic animals living in the hospital sewers and at or near a wastewater treatment plant to study the dissemination of clinically relevant resistance through hospital and urban effluents. After comparison of the antibiotic-resistant profiles of E. cloacae complex strains, a more detailed analysis of 41 whole-genome-sequenced strains demonstrated that the most common sequence type, ST114 (n = 20), was present in human (n=9) and nonhuman (n = 11) samples, with a close genetic relatedness. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed local circulation of this pathogenic lineage in diverse animal species. In addition, nanopore sequencing and specific synteny of an IncHI2/ST1/ blaCTX-M-15 plasmid recovered on the majority of these ST114 clones (n = 18) indicated successful worldwide diffusion of this mobile genetic element.},

abstract = {Oxytetracycline-resistant (OT(r)) mesophilic aeromonads were recovered from untreated hospital effluent (72 isolates) and from fish farm hatchery tanks (91 isolates) at sites within the English Lake District, Cumbria, England. The transfer of OT(r) plasmids from these isolates was investigated. Using Escherichia coli J53-1 as a recipient, 11 isolates from the hospital site and 6 isolates from the fish farm site transferred OT(r) plasmids (designated pFBAOT1 to 17). Original isolates were identified using fatty acid methyl ester and fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism comparisons as either Aeromonas hydrophila HG3 (eight isolates), A. veronii b.v. sobria HG8 (six isolates), and A. caviae HGB5 (one isolate). One isolate remained unidentified, and one could not be assigned a taxonomic designation beyond the genus level. Plasmids pFBAOT1 to -17 were screened for the presence of the tetracycline resistance determinants Tel A to E and Tet G. Only determinant Tet A (10 plasmids) was detected in these plasmids, with 7 tet gene determinants remaining unclassified. In all cases, Tet A was located on a 5.5-kb EcoRI restriction fragment. Hybridization with inc-rep probes N, P, Q, W, and U showed pFBAOT3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -9, and -11, from the hospital environment, to be IncU plasmids. Further, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses and DNA probing demonstrated that pFBAOT plasmids were closely related to IncU OT(r) plasmids pASOT, pASOT2, pASOT3, pRAS1 (originally isolated from A. salmonicida strains from fish farms in Scotland and Norway, respectively), and pIE420 (isolated from a German hospital E. coli strain). In addition, DNA analyses demonstrated that plasmids pRAS1 and pIE420 had identical RFLP profiles and that all fragments hybridized to each other.

These results provided direct evidence that related tetracycline resistance-encoding plasmids have disseminated between different Aeromonas species and E. coli and between the human and aquaculture environments in distinct geographical locations. Collectively, these findings provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the aquaculture and human compartments of the environment behave as a single interactive compartment.},

abstract = {Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered to be a reservoir and a source of bacterial resistance. Worryingly, the presence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CRGNB) in WWTPs has recently been reported, but there are still many research gaps regarding its emergence and impact. The distribution of CRGNB in the different stages of a WWTP in Colombia and the relationship between the physicochemical factors involved with their presence are described in this paper. Additionally, given the impact on public health, the CRGNB detected were compared with isolates previously found in hospital patients. Residual water samples were taken from five different stages of a WWTP between January and July 2017. A total of 390 GNB were isolated, and a significant frequency of CRGNB harboring blaKPC-2 (38.2%, n = 149/390) was detected, of which 57% were Enterobacteriaceae, 41.6% Aeromonadaceae, and 1.3% Pseudomonadaceae. The Enterobacteriaceae were more frequent in the raw effluent compared to the Aeromonadaceae, which in turn were more prevalent in the recycled activated sludge and final effluent. Environmental variables such as pH, oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, and temperature were significantly correlated with the quantification of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) at specific points in the WWTP. Interestingly, isolated K. pneumoniae harboring blaKPC-2 from the WWTPs were diverse and did not relate genetically to the hospital strains with which they were compared. In conclusion, these results confirm the worrying scenario of the dissemination and persistence of emerging contaminants such as CRGNB harboring blaKPC-2, and reinforce the need to establish strategies aimed at containing this problem using multifocal interventions.},

abstract = {Multidrug-resistant bacteria cause difficult-to-treat infections and pose a risk for modern medicine. Sources of multidrug-resistant bacteria include hospital, municipal and slaughterhouse wastewaters. In this study, bacteria with resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins were isolated from all three wastewater biotopes, including a maximum care hospital, municipal wastewaters collected separately from a city and small rural towns and the wastewaters of two pig and two poultry slaughterhouses. The resistance profiles of all isolates against clinically relevant antibiotics (including $\beta$-lactams like carbapenems, the quinolone ciprofloxacin, colistin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) were determined at the same laboratory. The bacteria were classified according to their risk to human health using clinical criteria, with an emphasis on producers of carbapenemases, since carbapenems are prescribed for hospitalized patients with infections with multi-drug resistant bacteria. The results showed that bacteria that pose the highest risk, i. e., bacteria resistant to all $\beta$-lactams including carbapenems and ciprofloxacin, were mainly disseminated by hospitals and were present only in low amounts in municipal wastewater. The isolates from hospital wastewater also showed the highest rates of resistance against antibiotics used for treatment of carbapenemase producers and some isolates were susceptible to only one antibiotic substance. In accordance with these results, qPCR of resistance genes showed that 90% of the daily load of carbapenemase genes entering the municipal wastewater treatment plant was supplied by the clinically influenced wastewater, which constituted approximately 6% of the wastewater at this sampling point. Likewise, the signature of the clinical wastewater was still visible in the resistance profiles of the bacteria isolated at the entry into the wastewater treatment plant. Carbapenemase producers were not detected in slaughterhouse wastewater, but strains harboring the colistin resistance gene mcr-1 could be isolated. Resistances against orally available antibiotics like ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were widespread in strains from all three wastewaters.},

abstract = {Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKP) isolated from influent (I) and effluent (E) of two wastewater treatment plants, with (S1) or without (S2) hospital contribution, were investigated. The strains belonged to the Kp1 phylogroup, their highest frequency being observed in S1, followed by S2. The phenotypic and genotypic hypervirulence tests were negative for all the strains tested. At least one carbapenemase gene (CRG), belonging to the blaKPC, blaOXA-48, blaNDM and blaVIM families, was observed in 63% of CPKP, and more than half co-harboured two to four CRGs, in different combinations. Only five CRG variants were observed, regardless of wastewater type: blaKPC-2, blaNDM-1, blaNDM-6, blaVIM-2, and blaOXA-48. Sequence types ST258, ST101 and ST744 were common for both S1 and S2, while ST147, ST525 and ST2502 were found only in S1 and ST418 only in S2. The strains tested were multi-drug resistant (MDR), all being resistant to beta-lactams, cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams and fluoroquinolones, followed by various resistance profiles to aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, tigecycline, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. After principal component analysis, the isolates in S1 and S2 groups did not cluster independently, confirming that the antibiotic susceptibility patterns and gene-type profiles were both similar in the K. pneumoniae investigated, regardless of hospital contribution to the wastewater type.},

The objectives of this study were to quantify the presence of P. aeruginosa in wastewater of our hospital, to determine their antibiotic-resistance profile and to potentially trace clinical antibiotic-resistant strains from patients to wastewater. Specimens were taken at the end of the wastewater network of our hospital just before the reject in the collective network of the town. Two specimens were taken each Monday during 12 weeks. All P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from hospitalised patients during the study period were collected. Genotyping of both clinical and wastewater isolates was determined by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The antibiotic-resistance profile of wastewater isolates was different from that of clinical isolates. The mechanisms involved in antibiotic resistance were different according to the origin of the isolates (wastewater versus human isolates). There was no common PFGE pattern in antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa from humans and wastewater. This study suggests that the risk of spread of antibiotic resistance in hospital wastewater is limited. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Isolates from the different types of water and isolation dates clustered together, suggesting the persistence and capacity to propagate across distinct aquatic environments. The most prevalent MLST groups were ST10 complex and ST131. Almost all isolates (98%) carried mutations in the chromosomal genes gyrA and/or parC, and 10% possessed the genes qepA, aac(6('))-Ib-cr and/or qnrS1. Over 80% of the isolates were resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics (MDR >/= 3). The most prevalent beta-lactamase encoding gene was blaTEM, followed by blaCTX-M-15, co-existing with plasmid mediated quinolone resistance. The plasmid replicon types of the group IncF were the most prevalent and distributed by different MLST groups. The genes aac(6('))-Ib-cr and/or qnrS1 could be transferred by conjugation in combination with the genes blaTEM,blaSHV-12 or blaOXA-1 and the plasmid replicon types I1-Igamma, K, HI2 and/or B/O. The potential of multidrug resistant E. coli with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, harboring mobile genetic elements and with ability to conjugate and transfer resistance genes, to spread and persist across different aquatic environments was demonstrated.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as an emerging environmental pollutant, have received widespread attention. There are many studies on ARGs in water and soil. However, there are few studies on airborne ARGs. We used qPCR to detect 19 ARG subtypes in six atmospheric environments. Among the different atmospheric environments including wastewater treatment plant (fine screens and sludge thickener), bathroom, laboratory, hospital and outdoor, the highest total concentration of ARGs is detected in the haze outdoor (9 × 105 copies/m3), while the lowest is in the bathroom atmosphere (4.2 × 104 copies/m3). Furthermore, $\beta$-lactam ARGs are found to be the dominant ARGs in these 6 atmospheric environments. Due to the large number and widespread use of antibiotics, the airborne ARGs in hospital have the highest diversity and equitability. The $\beta$-lactam ARGs are significantly positively correlated with sulfonamides ARGs, indicating the mechanism of co-resistance since these two ARGs may be on the same genetic elements and thus simultaneously exhibit both resistances. The network analysis provides potential host information between the airborne ARGs and the coexisted microbial taxa. Sphingomonas and Bradyhizoblum strains presumably host for tetracycline and $\beta$-lactam ARGs, respectively. The ADDoutdoor of blaTEM-1 was 7.8 × 105 copies/d/kg, more than the ADD (7.6 × 103 copies/d/kg) of blaTEM-1 by drinking water. We can't ignore ARGs in the atmospheric environments.},

abstract = {Salmonella enterica is a major cause of gastroenteritis usually caused by animal-based contaminated foods. Since the current passive surveillance is not sufficient to detect all infections and infection sources, we determined the prevalence of Salmonella isolated from sewage influent of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and compared the characteristics of human and food isolates to identify the infection sources. Sewage influent samples were collected monthly from two WWTPs located in the Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, for three years. Serotypes, antimicrobial resistances, isolation periods, isolated areas, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of six isolates belonging to five serotypes were consistent with those of the isolates from patients. Real-time PCR for Salmonella indicated that sewage influents reflect cases of patients infected with Salmonella, including unreported cases. Serovars Schwarzengrund and Anatum were predominant in sewage, but not in humans, and their characteristics were closely related or identical to those isolated from poultry heart and liver, respectively. These results suggest that sewage influent contains Salmonella isolates from humans and that some originated from unreported human cases infected by poultry-associated products. Therefore, it is necessary to take countermeasures against Salmonella infection based on the unreported cases, which would be disclosed by analysis of sewage influent. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

This study aimed to identify Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci and antibiotic resistance in patients with BSI in a burn intensive care unit (BICU). The environment, including sewage systems, were investigated for the presence of lytic bacteriophage. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January 2011 to December 2017, 486 patients with BSI were admitted to the BICU. Blood culture identified the main infectious organisms. Bacterial screening tests for antibiotic resistance included the D test and the modified Hodge test (MHT). Lytic bacteriophage was isolated from the environment. RESULTS In 486 patients with BSI, the main causative organisms were Gram-negative bacilli (64.6%), Gram-positive cocci (27.7%), and fungi (7.7%). The main pathogenic organisms that showed multidrug resistance (MDR) were Acinetobacter baumannii (26.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.2%). Bacteriophage was mainly isolated from Gram-negative bacilli. Screening of hospital and residential sewage systems identified increased levels of bacteriophage in hospital sewage. CONCLUSIONS The causative organisms of BSI and the presence of MDR in a hospital BICU were not typical, which supports the need for routine bacterial monitoring. Hospital sewage provides a potential source of bacteriophage for the treatment of MDR pathogenic bacteria.},

We recovered 646 Enterobacteriaceae (Eb) isolates from hospital, livestock manure, municipal wastewater-treatment plants, river sediment and soil for comprehensive analysis of resistance phenotypes, $\beta$-lactamase genes, integrons, integron-associated gene cassettes and the levels of DNA methylation. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that approximately 87.31 % isolates were multidrug resistant Eb. The $\beta$-lactamase genes were positively detected in 473 isolates with greater diversity in human or animal sourced Eb, while its prevalence was found to be highest in the Eb isolates from the natural environments. Forty-three gene cassettes (28 different types mediated by intI1) were detected in 53 (19.63 %) isolates, with greater diversity in Eb isolates from hospital and livestock manure. The multiple antibiotic resistance index of single strain was positively correlated with the 5-methylcytosine and showed a negative correlation with 6-methylademine. We conclude that the development of antibiotic resistance could possibly be coupled with DNA methylation, which might enhance the antimicrobial resistance and survival capacity of Eb. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Multidrug resistance mediated by $\beta$-lactamase in Gram-negative bacilli is a serious public health problem. Sewers are considered reservoirs of multiresistant bacteria due to presence of antibiotics that select them and favor their dissemination. The present study evaluated the antibiotic resistance profile and $\beta$-lactamases production in Gram-negative bacilli isolates from hospital sewage and urban wastewater treatment plants (UWWTP) in Brazil. Bacteria were isolated and identified with biochemical tests. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by the disk-diffusion method and detection of extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase and carbapenemases by enzymatic inhibitor and conventional PCR. Differences in resistance to amoxicillin clavulanic, aztreonam, cefepime, and cefotaxime were observed in hospital sewage compared with urban sewage (p < 0.05). The multidrug-resistant phenotype was observed in 33.3% of hospital sewage isolates (p = 0.0025). $\beta$-lactamases genes were found in 35.6% of isolates, with the most frequent being blaKPC and blaTEM (17.8%), and blaSHV and blaCTX-M (13.3% and 8.9%, respectively). The data obtained are relevant, since the bacteria detected are on the priority pathogens list from the World Health Organization and hospital sewage could be released untreated into the municipal collection system, which may favor the spread of resistance. Changes in hospital sewage discharge practices, as well as additional technologies regarding effluent disinfection in the UWWTP, can prevent the spread of these bacteria into the environment and negative impact on water resources. {\textcopyright} 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Species identification of Enterococcus revealed distinct associations across the continuum. Of the 8430 isolates collected, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis were the main species in urban wastewater (90%) and clinical human isolates (99%); Enterococcus hirae predominated in cattle (92%) and feedlot catch-basins (60%), whereas natural streams harbored environmental Enterococcus spp. Whole-genome sequencing of E. faecalis (n = 366 isolates) and E. faecium (n = 342 isolates), revealed source clustering of isolates, indicative of distinct adaptation to their respective environments. Phenotypic resistance to tetracyclines and macrolides encoded by tet(M) and erm(B) respectively, was prevalent among Enterococcus spp. regardless of source. For E. faecium from cattle, resistance to $\beta$-lactams and quinolones was observed among 3% and 8% of isolates respectively, compared to 76% and 70% of human clinical isolates. Clinical vancomycin-resistant E. faecium exhibited high rates of multi-drug resistance, with resistance to all $\beta$-lactam, macrolides, and quinolones tested. Differences in the AMR profiles among isolates reflected antimicrobial use practices in each sector of the One-Health continuum.},

In this study, we investigate the presence of New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) producing bacteria in the 99 water samples in Beijing City, including river water, treated drinking water, raw water samples from the pools and sewage from 4 comprehensive hospitals. For the blaNDM-1 positive isolate, antimicrobial susceptibility testing was further analyzed, and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to determine the genetic relationship among the NDM-1 producing isolates from sewage and human, as well as the clinical strains without NDM-1. The results indicate that there was a higher isolation of NDM-1 producing Acinetobacter baumannii from the sewage of the hospitals, while no NDM-1 producing isolates were recovered from samples obtained from the river, drinking, or fishpond water. Surprisingly, these isolates were markedly different from the clinical isolates in drug resistance and pulsed field gel electrophoresis profiles, suggesting different evolutionary relationships. Our results showed that the hospital sewage may be one of the diffusion reservoirs of NDM-1 producing bacteria. {\textcopyright} 2013 Zhang et al.},

abstract = {Hospital sewage plays a key role in the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) by serving as an environmental antimicrobial resistance reservoir. In this study, we aimed to characterize the cephalosporin- and carbapenem-resistant isolates from hospital sewage and receiving rivers. The results showed that ESBL (bla(CTX-M)) and carbapenemase genes (bla(NDM) and bla(KPC)) were widely detected in a number of different bacterial species. These resistance genes were mainly harbored in Enterobacteriaceae, followed by Acinetobacter and Aeromonas isolates. More attention should be given to these bacteria as important vectors of ARGs in the environment. Furthermore, we showed that the multidrug resistance phenotype was highly prevalent, which was found in 85.5% Enterobacteriaceae and 75% Acinetobacter strains. Notably, the presence of carbapenemase genes in isolates from treated effluents and receiving rivers indicates that the discharges of wastewater treatment plants could be an important source for high-risk resistance genes propagation to the environment. In conclusion, this study shows a high prevalence of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing bacteria in hospital sewage and receiving rivers in China. These findings have serious implications for human health, and also suggest the need for more efforts to control the dissemination of resistant bacteria from hospital sewage into the environment.},

A total of 705 extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli (ESCr ) were obtained from: cattle feces (CFeces, n = 382), catch basins (CBasins, n = 137), surrounding streams (SStreams, n = 59), beef processing plants (BProcessing, n = 4), municipal sewage (MSewage; n = 98) and human clinical specimens (CHumans, n = 25). Generic isolates (663) included: CFeces (n = 142), CBasins (n = 185), SStreams (n = 81), BProcessing (n = 159) and MSewage (n = 96). All isolates were screened for antimicrobial susceptibility to 9 antimicrobials and two clavulanic acid combinations. In ESCr, oxytetracycline (87.7%), ampicillin (84.4%) and streptomycin (73.8%) resistance phenotypes were the most common, with source influencing AMR prevalence (p < 0.001). In generic E. coli, oxytetracycline (51.1%), streptomycin (22.6%), ampicillin (22.5%) and sulfisoxazole (14.3%) resistance were most common. Overall, 88.8% of ESCr, and 26.7% of generic isolates exhibited multi-drug resistance (MDR). MDR in ESCr was high from all sources: CFeces (97.1%), MSewage (96.9%), CHumans (96%), BProcessing (100%), CBasins (70.5%) and SStreams (61.4%). MDR in generic E. coli was lower with CFeces (45.1%), CBasins (34.6%), SStreams (23.5%), MSewage (13.6%) and BProcessing (10.7%). ESBL phenotypes were confirmed in 24.7% (n = 174) ESCr and 0.6% of generic E. coli. Prevalence of bla genes in ESCr were blaCTXM (30.1%), blaCTXM-1 (21.6%), blaTEM (20%), blaCTXM-9 (7.9%), blaOXA (3.0%), blaCTXM-2 (6.4%), blaSHV (1.4%) and AmpC $\beta$-lactamase blaCMY (81.3%). The lower AMR in ESCr from SStreams and BProcessing and higher AMR in CHumans and CFeces likely reflects antimicrobial use in these environments. Although MDR levels were higher in ESCr as compared to generic E. coli, AMR to the same antimicrobials ranked high in both ESCr and generic E. coli sub-populations. This suggests that both sub-populations reflect similar AMR trends and are equally useful for AMR surveillance. Considering that MDR ESCr MSewage isolates were obtained without enrichment, while those from CFeces were obtained with enrichment, MSewage may serve as a hot spot for MDR emergence and dissemination.},

abstract = {AmpC-type $\beta$-lactamases severely impair treatment of many bacterial infections, due to their broad spectrum (they hydrolyze virtually all $\beta$-lactams, except fourth-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems) and the increasing incidence of plasmid-mediated versions. The original chromosomal AmpCs are often tightly regulated, and their expression is induced in response to exposure to $\beta$-lactams. Regulation of mobile ampC expression is in many cases less controlled, giving rise to constitutively resistant strains with increased potential for development or acquisition of additional resistances. We present here the identification of two integron-encoded ampC genes, blaIDC-1 and blaIDC-2 (integron-derived cephalosporinase), with less than 85% amino acid sequence identity to any previously annotated AmpC. While their resistance pattern identifies them as class C $\beta$-lactamases, their low isoelectric point (pI) values make differentiation from other $\beta$-lactamases by isoelectric focusing impossible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of an ampC gene cassette within a class 1 integron, providing a mobile context with profound potential for transfer and spread into clinics. It also allows bacteria to adapt expression levels, and thus reduce fitness costs, e.g., by cassette-reshuffling. Analyses of public metagenomes, including sewage metagenomes, show that the discovered ampCs are primarily found in Asian countries.},

We investigated the abundance and AMR profiles of three different species over a complete wastewater pathway during a one-year sampling campaign, as well as including antimicrobial consumption and antimicrobial concentrations analysis. A total of 2886 isolates (997 Escherichia coli, 863 Klebsiella spp., and 1026 Aeromonas spp.) were cultured from the 211 samples collected. The bacterial AMR profiles mirrored the antimicrobial consumption in the respective locations, which were highest in the hospital. However, the contribution of hospital wastewater to AMR found in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was below 10% for all antimicrobials tested. We found high concentrations (7–8 logs CFU/L) of the three bacterial species in all wastewaters, and they survived the wastewater treatment (effluent concentrations were around 5 log CFU/L), showing an increase of E. coli in the receiving river after the WWTP discharge. Although the WWTP had no effect on the proportion of AMR, bacterial species and antimicrobial residues were still measured in the effluent, showing the role of wastewater contamination in the environmental surface water.},

We investigated the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) before and after treatment in five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in different areas of the Monastir Governorate (Tunisia). Three of these WWTPs (Frina, Sahline and Zaouiet) use a conventional activated sludge process as secondary treatment, whereas the WWTP located in Beni Hassen applies an ultraviolet disinfection step after the activated sludge process and the WWTP located in Moknine treats wastewater using naturally aerated lagoons as a secondary treatment process. The abundance of six ARGs (blaCTX-M, blaTEM, qnrA, qnrS, sul I and ermB) and the class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1) were determined by quantitative PCR. All ARGs and the intI1 gene were detected in the wastewater samples, except the blaCTX-M gene, which was not detected in both influent and effluent samples from Sahline and Beni Hassen WWTPs, and the qnrS gene, which was not detected neither in the WWTP influent in Moknine nor in the WWTP effluent in Beni Hassen. Although the relative concentration of ARGs was generally found to be similar between samples collected before and after the wastewater treatment, the abundance of blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and qnrS genes was higher in the effluent of the Frina WWTP which, unlike other WWTPs, not only receives domestic or industrial sewage but also untreated hospital waste. To the best of our knowledge, this study quantified for the first time the abundance of ARGs in different Tunisian WWTPs, and the results agree with previous studies suggesting that conventional wastewater treatment does not efficiently reduce ARGs. Therefore, these findings could be useful to improve the design or operation of WWTPs.},

abstract = {Surface waters are an unappreciated reservoir of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Poor sanitation brings different species of environmental bacteria into contact, facilitating horizontal gene transfer. To investigate the role of surface waters as potential reservoirs of AMR, we studied the point prevalence of fecal contamination, AMR genes, and Enterobacteriaceae in an urban lake and rural river system in Northeast Brazil in comparison with a lake and sewer system in Northeast Ohio in the United States. Surface water samples were examined for evidence of human fecal contamination using microbial source tracking and screened for plasmid-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance and carbapenemase genes. Enterobacteriaceae were detected using selective agar followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing and detection of AMR genes by microarray, and classified by repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction and multilocus sequence typing. Concentrations of human fecal bacteria in the Brazilian urban lake and sewage in Northeast Ohio were similarly high. Filtered water samples from the Brazilian urban lake, however, showed the presence of blaOXA-48, blaKPC, blaVIM-2, qnrS, and aac(69)-lb-cr, whereas only blaVIM-2 was identified in raw sewage from Northeast Ohio. From the Brazilian urban lake, 85% of the Enterobacteriaceae (n = 40) cultured were resistant to at least one clinically important antibiotic, including ST131 Escherichia coli harboring the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase CTX-M. Although two isolates demonstrated polymyxin resistance, mcr-1/2 was not detected. Our findings indicate that surface waters in an urban Brazilian site can serve as an environmental reservoir of AMR and that improving wastewater treatment and sanitation generally may ameliorate AMR dissemination.},

abstract = {The main objective of this study was to investigate the antibiotic resistance (AR) levels in wastewater (WW) and the impact on the receiving river. Samples were collected once per season over one year in the WW of a hospital, in the raw and treated WW of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as well as upstream and downstream from the release of WWTPs effluents into the Zenne River (Belgium). Culture-dependent methods were used to quantify Escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacteria resistant to amoxicillin, sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid and tetracycline. Six antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were quantified in both particle-attached (PAB) and free-living (FLB) bacteria. Our results showed that WWTPs efficiently removed antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) regardless of its AR profile. The ARGs levels were the highest in the hospital WW and were significantly reduced in both WWTPs. However, ARB and ARGs abundances significantly increased into the Zenne River downstream from the WWTPs outfalls. The variation in the relative abundance of ARGs through WW treatment differed depending on the WWTP, fraction, and gene considered. The sul1 and sul2 genes in PAB fraction showed significantly higher relative abundances in the effluent compared to the influent of both WWTPs. This study demonstrated that WWTPs could be hotspots for AR spread with significant impacts on receiving freshwater ecosystems. This was the first comprehensive study investigating at the same time antibiotics occurrence, fecal bacteria indicators, heterotrophic bacterial communities, and ARGs (distinguishing PAB and FLB) to assess AR levels in WW and impacts on the receiving river.},

abstract = {Antibiotics have been intensively used over the last decades in human and animal therapy and livestock, resulting in serious environmental and public health problems, namely due to the antibiotic residues concentration in wastewaters and to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This study aimed to access the contribution of some anthropological activities, namely urban household, hospital and a wastewater treatment plant, to the spread of antibiotic resistances in the treated wastewater released into the Mondego River, Coimbra, Portugal. Six sampling sites were selected in the wastewater network and in the river. The ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae of the water samples were enumerated, isolated and phenotypically characterized in relation to their resistance profile to 13 antibiotics. Some isolates were identified into species level and investigated for the presence of class A and class C-lactamases. Results revealed high frequency of resistance to the-lactam group, cefoxitin (53.5%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination (43.5%), cefotaxime (22.7%), aztreonam (21.3) cefpirome (19.2%), ceftazidime (16.2%) and to the non-lactam group, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol (21.1%), tetracycline (18.2%), followed by ciprofloxacin (14.1%). The hospital effluent showed the higher rates of resistance to all antibiotic, except two (chloramphenicol and gentamicin). Similarly, higher resistance rates were detected in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent compared with the untreated affluent. Regarding the multidrug resistance, the highest incidence was recorded in the hospital sewage and the lowest in the urban waste. The majority of the isolates altogether are potentially extended-spectrum-lactamases positive (ESBL+) (51.9%), followed by AmpC+ (44.4%) and ESBL+/AmpC+ (35.2%). The most prevalent genes among the potential ESBL producers were blaOXA (33.3%), blaTEM (24.1%) and blaCTX-M (5.6%) and among the AmpC producers were blaEBC (38.9%), blaFOX (1.9%) and blaCIT (1.9%). In conclusion, the hospital and the WWTP activities revealed to have the highest contribution to the spread of multidrug resistant bacteria in the study area. Such data is important for future management of the environmental and public health risk of these contaminants. This is the first embracing study in the water network of Coimbra region on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance determinants. Moreover, it is also the first report with the simultaneous detection of multiresistant bacteria producers of AmpC and ESBLs-lactamases in aquatic systems in Portugal.},

abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance in microorganisms are on the increase worldwide and are responsible for substantial cases of therapeutic failures. Resistance of species of Enterococcus to antibiotics is linked to their ability to acquire and disseminate antimicrobial resistance determinants in nature, and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered to be one of the main reservoirs of such antibiotic resistant bacteria. We therefore determined the antimicrobial resistance and virulence profiles of some common Enterococcus spp that are known to be associated with human infections that were recovered from hospital wastewater and final effluent of the receiving wastewater treatment plant in Alice, Eastern Cape. Methods: Wastewater samples were simultaneously collected from two sites (Victoria hospital and final effluents of a municipal WWTP) in Alice at about one to two weeks interval during the months of July and August 2014. Samples were screened for the isolation of enterococci using standard microbiological methods. The isolates were profiled molecularly after targeted generic identification and speciation for the presence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Results: Out of 66 presumptive isolates, 62 were confirmed to belong to the Enterococcus genusof which 30 were identified to be E. faecalis and 15 E. durans. The remaining isolates were not identified by the primers used in the screening procedure. Out of the six virulence genes that were targeted only three of them; ace, efaA, and gelE were detected. There was a very high phenotypic multiple resistance among the isolates and these were confirmed by genetic analyses. Conclusions: Analyses of the results obtained indicated that hospital wastewater may be one of the sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria to the receiving WWTP. Also, findings revealed that the final effluent discharged into the environment was contaminated with multi-resistant enterococci species thus posing a health hazard to the receiving aquatic environment as these could eventually be transmitted to humans and animals that are exposed to it.},

In this study, we investigated occurrence and characteristics of ESKAPE bacteria (E. faecium, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) and ESBL (extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamase) -producing E. coli in water samples of different processing stages of two German pig slaughterhouses (S1/S2) as well as their municipal wastewater treatment plants (mWWTPs). Furthermore, residues of various antimicrobials were determined. A total of 103 water samples were taken in delivery and dirty areas of the slaughterhouses S1/S2 (n = 37), their in-house WWTPs (n = 30) and mWWTPs including their receiving water bodies (n = 36). The recovered isolates (n = 886) were characterized for their antimicrobial resistance pattern and its genetic basis. Targeted species were ubiquitous along the slaughtering and wastewater chains. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses revealed a broad variety of resistance phenotypes and $\beta$-lactamase genes. Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and healthcare-associated (HA) MRSA were recovered only from mWWTPs and their preflooders. In contrast, the mcr-1 gene was exclusively detected in E. coli from S1/S2. Residues of five antimicrobials were detected in 14.9% (10/67) of S1/S2 samples in low range concentrations (≤1.30 $\mu$g/L), whereas 91.7% (33/36) of mWWTPs samples exhibited residues of 22 different antibiotics in concentrations of up to 4.20 $\mu$g/L. Target bacteria from S1/S2 and mWWTPs exhibited differences in their abundances, resistance phenotypes and genotypes as well as clonal lineages. S1/S2 samples exhibited bacteria with zoonotic potential (e.g. MRSA of CC398, E. coli of significant clones), whereas ESKAPE bacteria exhibiting resistances of clinical importance were mainly detected in mWWTPs. Municipal WWTPs seem to fail to eliminate these bacteria leading to a discharge into the preflooder and a subsequent dissemination into the surface water.},

abstract = {The prevalence of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria is increasing worldwide and remains a significant medical challenge which may lead to antimicrobial redundancy. The contribution of hospital effluent to the prevalence of resistance in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents is not fully understood. AMR bacteria contained in hospital effluent may be released into the aquatic and soil environments after WWTP processing. Hence, the objective of this study is to identify the extent hospital effluent contributes to contamination of these environments by comparing two WWTPs, one which receives hospital effluent and one which does not. AMR Escherichia coli were monitored in the two WWTPs. A model was developed using these monitored values to predict the effect of hospital effluent within a WWTP. The model predicted levels of AMR E. coli in the aquatic environment and potential bather exposure to AMR E. coli. The model results were highly variable. WWTP influent containing hospital effluent had a higher mean percentage of AMR E. coli; although, there appeared to be no within treatment plant effect on the prevalence of AMR E. coli. Examination of WWTP sludge showed a similar variation. There appeared to be no consistent effect from the presence of hospital effluent. The human exposure assessment model predicted swimmer intake of AMR E. coli between 6 and 193. CFU/100. ml sea water. It appears that hospital effluent is not the main contributing factor behind the development and persistence of AMR E. coli within WWTPs, although resistance may be too well-developed to identify an influence from hospital effluent. Mitigation needs to focus on the removal of already present resistant bacteria but for new or hospital specific antimicrobials focus needs to be on their limited release within effluents or separate treatment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Tolerance to metals, antibiotics, and disinfectants may represent an advantage for their ubiquity and opportunistic pathogenic potential. In this study, we compared five strains that differed on the origin (hospital effluent, tap water, mineral water) and in the susceptibility to aminoglycosides, regarding their tolerance to metals and disinfection. The growth kinetics and biofilm formation capacity were tested in four R. pickettii strains and one R. mannitolilytica at sub-inhibitory concentrations of aminoglycosides or arsenite. The survival to UV radiation, chlorine, or hydrogen peroxide was also compared in aminoglycoside resistant and susceptible strains. Aminoglycoside-resistant strains presented a higher tolerance to arsenite than the susceptible ones and either aminoglycosides or arsenite was observed to stimulate the biofilm formation. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of the aminoglycoside gentamicin or arsenite significantly decreased the growth rate and yield, but only arsenite caused a significant increase of the lag phase. Hydrogen peroxide presented higher disinfection effectiveness against aminoglycoside susceptible than against resistant strains, an effect that was not observed for UV or chlorine. Although this conclusion needs validation based on a larger number of isolates, including clinical, the results suggest that aminoglycoside resistance may be associated with traits that influence Ralstonia spp. fitness in the environment.},

Data on antibiotic consumption among hospitalized and general populations and levels of water contamination by antibiotics were collected. All isolated enterococci were genotypically identified to the species level, tested for in vitro antibiotic susceptibility, and typed by multilocus sequence typing. The erm(B) and mef(A) (macrolide resistance) and tet(M) (tetracycline resistance) genes were detected by PCR. Along the continuum, from 89 to 98% of enterococci, according to the sampled site, were identified as Enterococcus faecium. All E. faecium isolates from hospital and retirement home effluents were multiply resistant to antibiotics, contained erm(B) and mef(A) genes, and belonged to hospital-adapted clonal complex 17 (CC17). Even though this species remained dominant in the downstream continuum, the relative proportion of CC17 isolates progressively decreased in favor of other subpopulations of E. faecium that were more diverse, less resistant to antibiotics, and devoid of the classical macrolide resistance genes and that belonged to various sequence types. Antibiotic concentrations in waters were far below the MICs for susceptible isolates. CC17 E. faecium was probably selected in the gastrointestinal tract of patients under the pressure of administered antibiotics and then excreted together with the resistance genes in waters to progressively decrease along the continuum. {\textcopyright} 2013, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate the potential spread of gentamicin resistant (GENR) Escherichia coli isolates or GENR determinants from a Danish university hospital to the waste water environment. Waste water samples were collected monthly from the outlets of the hospital bed wards and the inlet of the related waste water treatment plant (WWTP) from October 2002 to August 2003. Waste water samples were also collected monthly from a residential area in the same period to be able to compare the prevalence of GENR E. coli isolates from hospital related and residential waste water. The waste water isolates were compared to GENR E. coli isolates obtained consecutively from September 2002 to September 2003 from patients mainly with urinary tract infections at the hospital with respect to Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. All isolates were investigated for GENR mechanisms (aac(3)-II, aac(3)-IV, ant(2″)-I, armA), phenotypic resistance pattern, and virulence genes (hlyA, chuA, sfaS, fogG, malX, traT, iutA, fyuA, iroN, cnf1) to investigate if the hospital and waste water could be reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance and virulence. The ability for GENR determinants to transfer horizontally was investigated by mating experiments. A total of 38, 15, 21, and two GENR E. coli were isolated from patients, the hospital outlets, the inlet of the WWTP, and the residential area, respectively. GENR E. coli were more prevalent in waste water from the hospital and the WWTP than in waste water from the residential area. PFGE profiling revealed no spread of specific patient isolates to the waste water. The aac(3)-II gene was detected both in patient and waste water isolates. Furthermore horizontal transfer of the aac(3)-II gene of patient origin to a recipient was shown in vitro, indicating a potential spread of the gene from patient isolates to waste water isolates. Regardless of origin, most isolates exhibited multi-resistance and contained several virulence genes. In conclusion, our study showed a possible spread of aac(3)-II from the hospital to the waste water. Most of the GENR E. coli isolates from both patients and waste water had a multi-resistant phenotype and contained virulence genes and should therefore be considered reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study describes the initial isolation and bacteriological activity of bacteriophages, circulating on dairy farms, the against S. aureus var. bovis. Samples of cow's milk secretions with signs of mastitis and sewage water were used as the study material. The isolation and production of pure bacteriophage lines were performed according to the double agar method. The method of studying a single cycle of phage reproduction was used to determine the duration of the latency period. Determination of the spectrum of the lytic activity of bacteriophages against the clinical isolates of the microorganisms was carried out by the drop method. As a result of the research, four phages, specific for S. aureus var. bovis were isolated: Phage SAvB07, Phage SAvB08, Phage SAvB12 and Phage SAvB14. The negative colonies of the isolated phages were 1–2 mm in size, rounded with clear edges, with varying degrees of transparency. The latency period of Phage SAvB14 was 35 min, with the number of active virions increasing by 8 orders. In the study on growth curves of other bacteriophages, taken in the experiment, the latency period was more than 35 min, and their titre increased by only two orders. Phage SAvB07, Phage SAvB08 and Phage SAvB12 were able to lyse the bacterial strains of S. aureus var. bovis in 25–45.6% of the cases (low lytic activity), whereas Phage SAvB14 lysed 94.1% of S. aureus strains were isolated from the cows. Studies have shown that among the bacteriophages we have studied, Phage SAvB14 with a short latency period has the best lytic action on the culture S. aureus var. bovis. The resulting bacteriophage strain can be used to create a bacteriophage-based drug for the treatment of mastitis in cows.},

abstract = {Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are widespread in hospitals and have been increasingly isolated from aquatic environments. The aim of the present study was to characterize extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL) and quinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from a hospital effluent, sanitary effluent, inflow sewage, aeration tank, and outflow sewage within a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), as well as river water upstream and downstream (URW and DRW, respectively), of the point where the WWTP treated effluent was discharged. $\beta$-lactamase (bla) genes, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR), and quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) were assessed by amplification and sequencing in 55 ESBL-positive and/or quinolone-resistant isolates. Ciprofloxacin residue was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography. ESBL-producing isolates were identified in both raw (n=29) and treated (n=26) water; they included Escherichia coli (32), Klebsiella pneumoniae (22) and Klebsiella oxytoca (1). Resistance to both cephalosporins and quinolone was observed in 34.4% of E. coli and 27.3% of K. pneumoniae. Resistance to carbapenems was found in 5.4% of K. pneumoniae and in K. oxytoca. Results indicate the presence of blaCTX-M (51/55, 92.7%) and blaSHV (8/55, 14.5%) ESBLs, and blaGES (2/55, 3.6%) carbapenemase-encoding resistance determinants. Genes conferring quinolone resistance were detected at all sites, except in the inflow sewage and aeration tanks. Quinolone resistance was primarily attributed to amino acid substitutions in the QRDR of GyrA (47%) or to the presence of PMQR (aac-(6')-Ib-cr, oqxAB, qnrS, and/or qnrB; 52.9%) determinants. Ciprofloxacin residue was absent only from URW. Our results have shown strains carrying ESBL genes, PMQR determinants, and mutations in the gyrA QRDR genes mainly in hospital effluent, URW, and DRW samples. Antimicrobial use, and the inefficient removal of MDR bacteria and antibiotic residue during sewage treatment, may contribute to the emergence and spreading of resistance in the environment, making this a natural reservoir.},

We investigated the presence and spread of transposons (elements that can move from one location to another in the genome), integrons (structures able to capture and incorporate gene cassettes) and resistance plasmids in strains isolated from polluted and unpolluted water. We recovered 231 Aeromonas and 250 fecal coliforms from water samplings with different degrees of pollution (hospital sewage, activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant, river water before and after treatment and water from an alpine lake). Sixteen Aeromonas spp. and 22 fecal coliforms carried intI, coding for the site-specific integrase of class 1 integrons, while 22 Aeromonas spp. and 14 fecal coliforms carried tnpA, the transposase gene of the Tn3-family of replicative transposons. The majority of intI and tnpA-positive strains were phenotypically resistant to at least four antibiotics. Integrons and transposons were mainly located on mobilizable plasmids. Our results did not detect common mobile structures in the two populations and therefore relativize the role played by Aeromonas spp. as vectors of antimicrobial resistance determinants between water and commensal gut bacteria.},

abstract = {Environments polluted with excessively high levels of antibiotics released from manufacturing sites can act as a source of transferable antibiotic resistance (AR) genes to human commensal and pathogenic bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate AR of bacteria isolated from the Sava river sediments (Croatia) at the discharge site of effluents from azithromycin production compared to those from the upstream site and isolates collected in Croatian hospitals. A total of 228 environmental strains of azithromycin-resistant bacteria were isolated and identified, with 124 from the discharge site and 104 from the upstream site. In addition, a total of 90 clinical, azithromycin-resistant streptococcal and staphylococcal isolates obtained from the Croatian Reference Center for Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance were analyzed. PCR screening of isolates on 11 relevant macrolide-resistance genes (MRGs) showed that discharge isolates had greater detection frequencies for 4 gene targets (ermB, msrE, mphE and ermF) compared to upstream isolates. Among clinical isolates, the most frequently detected gene was ermB, followed by msrD, mefE and mefC. The discharge site demonstrated a greater abundance of isolates with co-occurrence of two different MRGs (predominantly msrE-mphE) than the upstream site, but a lower abundance than the clinical sources (most commonly msrD-mefE). The simultaneous presence of three or even four MRGs was specific for the discharge and clinical isolates, but not for the upstream isolates. When MRG results were sorted by gene mechanism, the ribosomal methylation (erm) and protection genes (msr) were the most frequently detected among both the discharge and the clinical isolates. Following sequencing, high nucleotide sequence similarity was observed between ermB in the discharge isolates and the clinical streptococcal isolates, suggesting a possible transfer of the ermB gene between bacteria of clinical and environmental origin. Our study highlights the importance of environmental bacterial populations as reservoirs for clinically relevant macrolide-resistance genes.},

abstract = {Discharge of antimicrobial residues and resistant bacteria in hospital effluents is supposed to have strong impacts on the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the environment. This study aimed to characterize the effluents of the Gabriel Montpied teaching hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France, by simultaneously measuring the concentration of ciprofloxacin and of biological indicators resistant to this molecule in biofilms formed in the hospital effluent and by comparing these data to ciprofloxacin consumption and resistant bacterial isolates of the hospital. Determination of the measured environmental concentration of ciprofloxacin by spot sampling and polar organic chemical integrative (POCIS) sampling over 2 weeks, and comparison with predicted environmental concentrations produced a hazard quotient >1, indicating a potential ecotoxicological risk. A negative impact was also observed with whole hospital effluent samples using the Tetrahymena pyriformis biological model. During the same period, biofilms were formed within the hospital effluent, and analysis of ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates indicated that Gamma-Proteobacteria were numerous, predominantly Aeromonadaceae (69.56%) and Enterobacteriaceae (22.61%). Among the 115 isolates collected, plasmid-mediated fluoroquinolone-resistant genes were detected, with mostly aac(6′)-lb-cr and qnrS. In addition, 60% of the isolates were resistant to up to six antibiotics, including molecules mostly used in the hospital (aminosides and third-generation cephalosporins). In parallel, 1247 bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients and resistant to at least one of the fluoroquinolones were collected. Only 5 of the 14 species identified in the effluent biofilm were also found in the clinical isolates, but PFGE typing of the Gram-negative isolates found in both compartments showed there was no clonality among the strains. Altogether, these data confirm the role of hospital loads as sources of pollution for wastewater and question the role of environmental biofilms communities as efficient shelters for hospital-released resistance genes.},

abstract = {The rise of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE) has led to treatment challenges in hospital settings worldwide. Hospital wastewater (HW) might disseminate this threat to the aquatic environment. Thus, this study elucidates the VRE resistance quotient (RQ) of different environmental matrixes in wastewater and compares genomic determinants of VRE strains recovered from HW to water resources. Presumptive Enterococcus spp. and VRE were quantified and isolated using standard microbiological procedures. Fourteen VRE genomes were then sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq X™ Ten platform. Subsequently, VRE genomes were compared based on antibiotic resistance genes, plasmids, bacteriophages, insertion sequences, transposons, virulence and pathogenicity. Wastewater effluent showed the highest RQ among all sampled matrixes. The phylogeny of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VREfs) and E. faecium (VREfm) revealed a tree structure based on their respective sequence type. A comparative genomic analysis of 14 genomes highlighted regions encoding phage protein, phage holin, phage integrase, integrase and transposase on both query genomes and the reference genome. Acquired resistance to vancomycin was conferred by vanA, vanN, vanL, vanG and the intrinsic resistance vanC operons. Plasmids were dominated by the presence of conserved areas of the replication initiating genes (rep). The Tn3-like and Tn917 transposons were present in all erythromycin-carrying erm(B) isolated VRE genomes. All VRE genomes expect one were putatively predicted as human pathogens with varying degrees of virulence. The presence of such resistant bacteria in African water resource is of great public health concern. It is, therefore, recommended that these bacteria be tracked and characterised from different environments to contribute to improved epidemiological containment action.},

abstract = {The beta-lactams are the largest group of clinically applied antibiotics, and resistance to these is primarily associated with beta-lactamases. There is increasing understanding that these enzymes are ubiquitous in natural environments and henceforth, elucidating the global diversity, distribution, and mobility of beta-lactamase-encoding genes is crucial for holistically understanding resistance to these antibiotics. In this study, we screened 232 shotgun metagenomes from ten different environments against a custom-designed beta-lactamase database, and subsequently analyzed beta-lactamase homologs with a suite of bioinformatic platforms including cluster and network analyses. Three interrelated beta-lactamase clusters encompassed all of the human and bovine feces metagenomes, while beta-lactamases from soil, freshwater, glacier, marine, and wastewater grouped within a separate "environmental" cluster that displayed high levels of inter-network connectivity. Interestingly, almost no connectivity occurred between the "feces" and "environmental" clusters. We attributed this in part to the divergence in microbial community composition (dominance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes vs. Proteobacteria, respectively). The beta-lactamase diversity in the "environmental" cluster was significantly higher than in human and bovine feces microbiomes. Several class A, B, C, and D beta-lactamase homologs (bla(CTX-M), bla(KPC), bla(GES)) were ubiquitous in the "environmental" cluster, whereas bovine and human feces metagenomes were dominated by class A (primarily cfxA) beta-lactamases. Collectively, this study highlights the ubiquitous presence and broad diversity of beta-lactamase gene precursors in non-clinical environments. Furthermore, it suggests that horizontal transfer of beta-lactamases to human-associated bacteria may be more plausible from animals than from terrestrial and aquatic microbes, seemingly due to phylogenetic similarities.},

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were recovered from all samples from the landfill. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and/or Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common antibiotic-resistant bacteria recovered from all types of samples, followed by carbapenem-resistant E. coli and/or K. pneumoniae. Colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Psuedomonas aeruginosa, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were less common.

Using a collection obtained from various settings (hospitalised patients, community carriers, animals, fresh food, sewage, water), we investigated differences in antimicrobial susceptibility, distribution of antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence-associated determinants and phenotypes, and CRISPR loci in the context of the clonal relatedness of isolates. Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure revealed the presence of three major groups; two subgroups comprised almost exclusively HAI isolates, belonging to previously proposed enterococcal high-risk clonal complexes (HiRECCs) 6 and 28. Isolates of these two subgroups were significantly enriched in antimicrobial resistance genes, presumably produced a polysaccharide capsule and often carried the aggregation substance asa1; distribution of other virulence-associated genes, such as esp and cyl, formation of a biofilm and gelatinase production were more variable. Moreover, both subgroups showed a low prevalence of CRISPR-Cas 1 and 3 and presence of small CRISPR2 variants. Our study confirms the importance of HiRECCs in the population of E. faecalis and their confinement to the hospital settings.},

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered hotspots for the spread of ARGs. The aim of this work was to analyze the diversity of the highly prevalent ARGs blaCTX-M and blaTEM in bacterial and bacteriophage fractions associated with human and animal environments through the study of urban waste and animal residues discharged into WWTPs to provide information about the composition and maintenance of the current resistome in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The results showed that a putative extended-spectrum variant of the blaTEM gene was the most frequently detected, with blaTEM-116 being the most prevalent, while a recently described type, blaTEM-229, was also found. In the bacteriophage fraction, we detected blaCTX-M genes from four out of the five clusters described. The detection of blaCTX- M-9-like and blaCTX-M-25-like genes was unexpected based on surveys of the ARGs from clinical pathogens circulating regionally. The finding of divergent blaCTX-M sequences associated with previously reported environmental genes argues in favor of the natural environment as a reservoir of resistance genes. ARGs were detected in bacteriophages as frequently as in bacterial communities, and furthermore, the blaCTX-M genes were more diverse in the bacteriophage fraction. Bacteriophages might therefore play a role in the spread of ARGs in the environment, but they might also be used as “reporters” for monitoring circulating ARGs.},

abstract = {Background: Enterococci, ubiquitous colonizers of humans and other animals, play an increasingly important role in health-care associated infections (HAIs). It is believed that the recent evolution of two clinically relevant species, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium occurred in a big part in a hospital environment, leading to formation of high-risk enterococcal clonal complexes (HiRECCs), which combine multidrug resistance with increased pathogenicity and epidemicity. The aim of this study was to establish the species composition in wastewater, its marine recipient as well as a river estuary and to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of collected isolates. Molecular methods were additionally applied to test the presence of HiRRECC-related E. faecium. Results: Two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), their marine outfalls and Vistula river that influence significantly the quality of waters in Gulf of Gdansk were sampled to investigate the presence of Enterococcus spp. Four-hundred-twenty-eight isolates were obtained, including E. faecium (244 isolates, 57.0%), E. hirae (113 isolates, 26.4%) and E. faecalis (63 isolates, 14.7%); other species (E. gallinarum/casseliflavus, E. durans and E. avium) accounted for 1.9%. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed the presence of isolates resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, amipicillin, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (high-level resistance), especially among E. faecium, where such isolates were usually characterized by multilocus sequence types associated with nosocomial lineages 17, 18 and 78 of this species representing HiRECC, formerly called CC17. These isolates not only carried several resistance determinants but were also enriched in genes encoding pathogenicity factors (Esp, pili) and genes associated with mobile genetic elements (MGE), a feature also typical for nosocomial HiRECC. Conclusions: Our data show that WWTPs constitute an important source of enterococcal strains carrying antimicrobial resistance determinants, often associated with the presence of MGE, for the recipient water environment, thus increasing a pool of such genes for other organisms. The presence of HiRECCs in wastewaters and marine/river environment may indicate that adaptations gained in hospitals may be also beneficial for survival of such clones in other settings. There is an obvious need to monitor the release and spread of such strains in order to elucidate better ways to curb their dissemination. {\textcopyright} 2014 Sadowy and Luczkiewicz; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, we deciphered the core resistome disseminating from hospital wastewater to the aquatic environment by characterising the resistome, plasmidome, mobilome and virulome using metagenomic analysis. This study also elucidated different environmental resistome risks using shotgun-metagenomic assembly. The results showed that clinically relevant taxa were found in assessed matrices (Salmonella spp., Acinetobacter spp, Escherichia-Shigella spp., Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Vibrio spp.). For the plasmidome, we found 249 core plasmidome sequences that were shared among all assessed matrices. The core mobilome of 2424 mobile genetic elements shared among all assessed matrices was found. Regarding the virulome, we found 148 core virulence factors shared among all assessed samples, and the core virulome content was consistently shared across the most abundant bacterial genera. Although influent of wastewater showed considerable higher relative bacterial abundance (P = 0.008), hospital wastewater showed significant higher environmental resistome risk scores against all other assessed matrices, with an average of 46.34% (P = 0.001). These results suggest hospital wastewater, effluent and sewage sludge should be subjected to stringent mitigating measures to minimise such dissemination.},

abstract = {The wastewater of livestock slaughterhouses is considered a source of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria with clinical relevance and may thus be important for their dissemination into the environment. To get an overview of their occurrence and characteristics, we investigated process water (n=50) from delivery and unclean areas as well as wastewater (n=32) from the in-house wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of two German poultry slaughterhouses (slaughterhouses S1 and S2). The samples were screened for ESKAPE bacteria (Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) and Escherichia coli. Their antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and the presence of extended-spectrum-$\beta$-lactamase (ESBL), carbapenemase, and mobilizable colistin resistance genes were determined. Selected ESKAPE bacteria were epidemiologically classified using different molecular typing techniques. At least one of the target species was detected in 87.5% (n=28/32) of the wastewater samples and 86.0% (n=43/50) of the process water samples. The vast majority of the recovered isolates (94.9%, n=448/ 472) was represented by E. coli (39.4%), the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii (ACB) complex (32.4%), S. aureus (12.3%), and K. pneumoniae (10.8%), which were widely distributed in the delivery and unclean areas of the individual slaughterhouses, including their wastewater effluents. Enterobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., and P. aeruginosa were less abundant and made up 5.1% of the isolates. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses revealed that the recovered isolates exhibited diverse resistance phenotypes and $\beta$-lactamase genes. In conclusion, wastewater effluents from the investigated poultry slaughterhouses exhibited clinically relevant bacteria (E. coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, and species of the ACB and Enterobacter cloacae complexes) that contribute to the dissemination of clinically relevant resistances (i.e., blaCTX-M or blaSHV and mcr-1) in the environment.},

Taxonomic PCR quantifications of five FPB targeting Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and enterococci were performed. The WWTPs differed in their catchment areas being impacted by hospitals, food processing companies, or housing areas only. The total discharges of the analyzed ARGs and FPB were found to cluster independently of the sizes of the WWTPs with a maximum difference of two log units within one cluster. Initially, quantitative data evaluations revealed no significant difference between ARG categories and WWTP catchment areas. More distinct correlations became obvious with a Pearson correlation approach, where each single taxonomic marker is compared to each ARG target. Here, increased correlation of FPB (i.e. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and enterococci) with clinically relevant ARGs of the category of rarely occurring resistance genes (blaNDM-1, vanA) was found in WWTP effluents being influenced by hospital wastewaters.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant fecal bacteria (E. coli) in water along a medical center-wastewater treatment plant-river continuum (4 km). A multiresidue chemical analysis methodology, using solid phase extraction coupled with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, was performed to detect whether low levels of contamination by 34 antibiotics were related to antibiotic resistance of E. coli and antibiotic use. The contamination of water by antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant E. coli decreased along the continuum. Although amoxicillin was predominantly prescribed, only ofloxacin (1 ng{\textperiodcentered}L -1) and sulfamethoxazole (4 ng{\textperiodcentered}L -1) persisted in the river. At the retirement home, in the medical center, even though no tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole were consumed, the highest occurrences of antibiotic resistance were in classes of quinolones (42.0%), sulfonamides (24.0%), tetracyclines (38.0%), and penicillins (38.0%), mainly due to the presence of multiple antibiotic-resistance genes on class 1 integrons. Along the continuum, the occurrence of E. coli resistant to antibiotics and those carrying class 1 integrons decreased in water samples (p-value <0.001). Interestingly, in the river, only persistent antibiotic compounds (ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole) were found, but they did not correspond to the major resistances (tetracycline, amoxicillin) of E. coli. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

However, little is known about the contribution of untreated wastewater to the burden of antibiotic resistance in the Nigerian environment. In this study, a total of 143 ceftazidime-/cefpodoxime-resistant bacteria isolated from untreated wastewater and untreated wastewater-contaminated surface and groundwater in Nigeria were screened for extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL) genes, integrons and integron gene cassettes by PCR. The genetic environment of blaCTX-M-15 was mapped by PCR and potentially conjugative plasmids were detected among the isolates by degenerate primer MOB typing (DPMT). ESBL production was confirmed in 114 (79.7%) isolates and ESBL genes (blaSHV, blaCTX-M-15 and blaTEM) were detected in 85 (74.6%) ESBL-producing isolates. blaCTX-M-15 was associated with ISEcp1 and with orf477 in 12 isolates and with ISEcp1, IS26 and orf477 in six others. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of blaCTX-M-15 in hand-dug wells and borehole serving as sources of drinking water and a first report of the genetic environment of blaCTX-M-15 in environmental bacteria from Nigeria. The results of this study confirm untreated wastewater as an important medium for the spread of ESBL-producing bacteria within the Nigerian environment. Hence, the widespread practice of discharging untreated wastewater into the aquatic ecosystem in Nigeria is a serious risk to public health.},

abstract = {The spread of Gram-negative bacteria with plasmid-borne extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) has become a worldwide problem. Their prevalence is increasing, both in hospitals and in the environment. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae in municipal sewage and their emission to the ambient air and the river receiving effluent from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). In the group of 455 isolated strains, up to 19.8% (90 isolates) were phenotypic ESBL-producers. They were detected in the 63 (100%) of sewage samples analyzed, 7 (33.3%) of river water and in 10 (23.8%) of air samples collected at the WWTP area. The plasmid-mediated genes encoding beta-lactams resistance were detected in almost 10% out of bacteria of the WWTP's final effluents and in above 32% out of bacteria of air at the WWTP area. It confirms that those genes are released into the environment, which might facilitate further dissemination among environmental bacteria. Moreover, genes encoding antibiotic resistance were shown to be transferrable to an Escherichia coli recipient strain, which indicates a high possibility of horizontal gene transfer among strains of different genera within the sewage and environmental samples. This study demonstrated that despite the treatment, the municipal sewage may be a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance genes. This may pose a public health risk, which requires future evaluation and control. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The prevalence of $\beta$-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae has increased worldwide. Although antibiotic-resistant bacteria are usually associated with hospitals, there are a growing number of reports of resistant bacteria in other environments. Concern about resistant microorganisms outside the hospital setting highlights the need to investigate mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in isolates collected from the environment. The present study evaluated the resistance mechanism to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics in 40 isolates from hospital sewage and surface water from the Dil{\'{u}}vio Stream, Porto Alegre City, Southern Brazil. The multiplex PCR technique was used to detect several resistance genes of $\beta$-lactamases: extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBLs), carbapenemases, and $\beta$-lactamase AmpC. After genes, detection amplicons were sequenced to confirm their identification. The clonal relationship was established by DNA macrorestriction using the XbaI enzyme, followed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The results indicated that resistance genes were present in 85% of the isolates. The most prevalent genes encoded narrow-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase, such as TEM-1 and SHV-1 with 70% of the strains, followed by carbapenemase KPC and GES (45%), ESBL types SHV-5 and CTX-M-8 (27.5%), and AmpC (ACT-1/MIR-1) (2.5%). Twelve isolates contained only one resistance gene, 14 contained two, and eight isolates had three resistance genes. PFGE indicated a clonal relationship among K. pneumoniae isolates. It was not possible to establish a clonal relationship between Enterobacter sp. isolates. The results highlight the potential of these resistance genes to spread in the polluted environment and to present a health risk to communities. This report is the first description of these resistance genes present in environmental samples other than a hospital in the city of Porto Alegre/RS.},

We sought to characterize environmental E. coli isolates belonging to various pathotypes obtained from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and its receiving waters using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and an array of bioinformatics tools to elucidate the resistomes, virulomes, mobilomes, clonality, and phylogenies. Twelve multidrug-resistant (MDR) diarrheagenic E. coli isolates were obtained from the final effluent of a WWTP, and the receiving river upstream and downstream of the WWTP were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq machine. The multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis revealed that multiple sequence types (STs), the most common of which was ST69 (n = 4) and ST10 (n = 2), followed by singletons belonging to ST372, ST101, ST569, ST218, and ST200. One isolate was assigned to a novel ST ST11351. A total of 66.7% isolates were positive for $\beta$-lactamase genes with 58.3% harboring the blaTEM1B gene and a single isolate the blaCTX−M−14 and blaCTX−M−55 extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL) genes. One isolate was positive for the mcr-9 mobilized colistin resistance gene. Most antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were associated with mobile genetic support: class 1 integrons (In22, In54, In191, and In369), insertion sequences (ISs), and/or transposons (Tn402 or Tn21). A total of 31 virulence genes were identified across the study isolates, including those responsible for adhesion (lpfA, iha, and aggR), immunity (air, gad, and iss), and toxins (senB, vat, astA, and sat). The virulence genes were mostly associated with IS (IS1, IS3, IS91, IS66, IS630, and IS481) or prophages. Co-resistance to heavy metal/biocide, antibiotics were evident in several isolates. The phylogenomic analysis with South African E. coli isolates from different sources (animals, birds, and humans) revealed that isolates from this study mostly clustered with clinical isolates. Phylogenetics linked with metadata revealed that isolates did not cluster according to source but according to ST. The occurrence of pathogenic and MDR isolates in the WWTP effluent and the associated river is a public health concern.},

abstract = {Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) is a major cause of nosocomial infection and is categorized as high priority by the World Health Organization global priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In the past, livestock have been proposed as a putative reservoir for drug-resistant E. faecium strains that infect humans, and isolates of the same lineage have been found in both reservoirs. We undertook cross-sectional surveys to isolate E. faecium (including VREfm) from livestock farms, retail meat, and wastewater treatment plants in the United Kingdom. More than 600 isolates from these sources were sequenced, and their relatedness and antibiotic resistance genes were compared with genomes of almost 800 E. faecium isolates from patients with bloodstream infection in the United Kingdom and Ireland. E. faecium was isolated from 28/29 farms; none of these isolates were VREfm, suggesting a decrease in VREfm prevalence since the last UK livestock survey in 2003. However, VREfm was isolated from 1% to 2% of retail meat products and was ubiquitous in wastewater treatment plants. Phylogenetic comparison demonstrated that the majority of human and livestock-related isolates were genetically distinct, although pig isolates from three farms were more genetically related to human isolates from 2001 to 2004 (minimum of 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]). Analysis of accessory (variable) genes added further evidence for distinct niche adaptation. An analysis of acquired antibiotic resistance genes and their variants revealed limited sharing between humans and livestock. Our findings indicate that the majority of E. faecium strains infecting patients are largely distinct from those from livestock in this setting, with limited sharing of strains and resistance genes. IMPORTANCE The rise in rates of human infection caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) strains between 1988 to the 2000s in Europe was suggested to be associated with acquisition from livestock. As a result, the European Union banned the use of the glycopeptide drug avoparcin as a growth promoter in livestock feed. While some studies reported a decrease in VREfm in livestock, others reported no reduction. Here, we report the first livestock VREfm prevalence survey in the UK since 2003 and the first large-scale study using whole-genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between E. faecium strains in livestock and humans. We found a low prevalence of VREfm in retail meat and limited evidence for recent sharing of strains between livestock and humans with bloodstream infection. There was evidence for limited sharing of genes encoding antibiotic resistance between these reservoirs, a finding which requires further research.},

abstract = {The CTX-M-type extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBLs) present a serious public health threat as they have become nearly ubiquitous among clinical gram-negative pathogens, particularly the enterobacteria. To aid in the understanding and eventual control of the spread of such resistance genes, we sought to determine the diversity of CTX-M ESBLs not among clinical isolates, but in the environment, where weaker and more diverse selective pressures may allow greater enzyme diversification. This was done by examining the CTX-M diversity in municipal wastewater and urban coastal wetlands in southern California, United States, by Sanger sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplicons. Of the five known CTX-M phylogroups (1, 2, 8, 9, and 25), only genes from groups 1 and 2 were detected in both wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and group 1 genes were also detected in one of the two wetlands after a winter rain. The highest relative abundance of blaCTX-M group 1 genes was in the sludge of one WWTP (2.1 × 10-4 blaCTX-M copies/16S rRNA gene copy). Gene libraries revealed surprisingly high nucleotide sequence diversity, with 157 new variants not found in GenBank, representing 99 novel amino acid sequences. Our results indicate that the resistomes of WWTPs and urban wetlands contain diverse blaCTX-M ESBLs, which may constitute a mobile reservoir of clinically relevant resistance genes.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is a major public health concern. Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) represent a significant health threat as some strains are resistant to almost all available antibiotics. The aim of this research was to examine hospital effluent and municipal wastewater in an urban area in Ireland for CPE. Samples of hospital effluent (n = 5), municipal wastewater before (n = 5) and after (n = 4) the hospital effluent stream joined the municipal wastewater stream were collected over a nine-week period (May–June 2017). All samples were examined for CPE by direct plating onto Brilliance CRE agar. Isolates were selected for susceptibility testing to 15 antimicrobial agents in accordance with EUCAST criteria. Where relevant, isolates were tested for carbapenemase-encoding genes by real-time PCR. CPE were detected in five samples of hospital effluent, one sample of pre-hospital wastewater and three samples of post-hospital wastewater. Our findings suggest hospital effluent is a major contributor to CPE in municipal wastewater. Monitoring of hospital effluent for CPE could have important applications in detection and risk management of unrecognised dissemination of CPE in both the healthcare setting and the environment.},

abstract = {Aquatic environments are hotspots for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes due to pollution caused mainly by anthropogenic activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of wastewater effluents, informal settlements, hospital, and veterinary clinic discharges on the occurrence, antibiotic resistance profile and virulence signatures of Aeromonas spp. and Pseudomonas spp. isolated from surface water and wastewater. High counts of Aeromonas spp. (2.5 (± 0.8) – 3.3 (± 0.4) log10 CFU mL−1) and Pseudomonas spp. (0.6 (± 1.0) – 1.8 (± 1.0) log10 CFU mL−1) were obtained. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and MALDI-TOF characterization identified four species of Aeromonas and five of Pseudomonas. The isolates displayed resistance to 3 or more antibiotics (71% of Aeromonas and 94% of Pseudomonas). Aeromonas spp. showed significant association with the antibiotic meropenem ($\chi$2 = 3.993, P < 0.05). The virulence gene aer in Aeromonas was found to be positively associated with the antibiotic resistance gene blaOXA ($\chi$2 = 6.657, P < 0.05) and the antibiotic ceftazidime ($\chi$2 = 7.537, P < 0.05). Aeromonas recovered from both wastewater and surface water displayed high resistance to ampicillin and had higher multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) indices close to the hospital. Pseudomonas isolates on the other hand exhibited low resistance to carbapenems but very high resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins and cefixime. The results showed that some of the Pseudomonas spp. and Aeromonas spp. isolates were extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase producing bacteria. In conclusion, the strong association between virulence genes and antibiotic resistance in the isolates shows the potential health risk to communities through direct and indirect exposure to the water.},

Samples were collected at three sites in the periphery of Ouagadougou during two campaigns in 2008 and 2011. At each site, amendment led to changes in physico-chemical characteristics as shown by the increase in pH, CEC, total C, total N, and metal contents. Similarly, the numbers of total heterotrophic bacteria were higher in the amended fields than in the control ones. No sanitation indicators, i.e., coliforms, Staphylococci, and Enterococci, were detected. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) were detected at a low level in one amended field. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was detected from both campaigns at the three sites in the amended fields and only once in an unamended field. Diversity analysis showed some opportunistic pathogen isolates to be closely related to reference clinical strains responsible for nosocomial- or community-acquired infections in Northern countries. Antibiotic resistance tests showed that P. aeruginosa and Bcc isolates had a wild-type phenotype and that most S. maltophilia isolates had a multi-drug resistance profile with resistance to 7 to 15 antibiotics. Then we were able to show that amendment led to an increase of some human opportunistic pathogens including multi-drug resistant isolates. Although the application of untreated urban waste increases both soil organic matter content and therefore soil fertility, the consequences of this practice on human health should be considered.},

However, its role in the spread of antibiotic resistances in the human population remains poorly investigated. We used whole genome sequencing to analyze 25 KPC-2-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from sewage water collected during a 3-year period and three clinical Citrobacter freundii isolates from a tertiary hospital in the same collection area in Spain. We detected a common, recently described, IncP-6 plasmid carrying the gene blaKPC-2 in 21 isolates from both sources. The plasmid was present in diverse environmental bacterial species of opportunistic pathogens such as C. freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Raoultella ornithinolytica. The 40,186 bp IncP-6 plasmid encoded 52 coding sequences and was composed of three uniquely combined regions that were derived from other plasmids recently reported in different countries of South America. The region harboring the carbapenem resistance gene (14 kb) contained a Tn3 transposon disrupted by an ISApu-flanked element and the core sequence composed by ISKpn6/blaKPC-2/$\Delta$blaTEM-1/ISKpn27.

These data could be useful to raise awareness about the potential risk of spreading ESBLEC strains in the community. Water samples were collected weekly over a 10-week period, from one urban sewage treatment plant (STP), one rural STP and one hospital complex's wastewater (HWW) in Turkey. Mean E. coli and ESBLEC loads were determined for each sampling point. For the 580 ESBLEC isolated, antimicrobial resistance profiles, phylogenetic grouping, presence of common beta-lactamese-typesand integrons were studied using PCR. The mean ESBLEC ratio was accounted for 0.58%, 0,12%, 1.53% of the total E. coli in urban, rural untreated wastewater and HWW, respectively. These values were higher for the outlets. The mean number of different antimicrobial classes to which the strains were resistant was highest in urban STP (4.0± 1.6). The antimicrobial resistance ratios of ESBLEC strains isolated from HWW were observed to be in between those of urban and rural STPs. The most common phylogenetic group was C composing (29.7%) and the most susceptible strains belonged to phylogroup B1. Wastewater treatments without sufficient decontamination, resulting in artificial selection of ESBLEC might lead to public health risk as these strains reach communities through environment. To avoid such risks and protect the human health as well as the environment, well-established decontamination measures imposing barriers against this artificial selection should be implemented.},

In addition, the impact of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) on the spread of genes specific to fecal indicator bacteria and genes encoding antimicrobial resistance in water bodies was also determined. Samples of hospital wastewater (HWW), untreated wastewater (UWW), and treated wastewater (TWW) evacuated from a WWTP were collected, and samples of river water were taken upstream (URW) and downstream (DRW) from the wastewater discharge point to determine, by qPCR, the presence of genes specific to BFG, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, and the abundance of 11 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and two integrase genes. The total number of bacterial cells (TCN) in the examined samples was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Genes specific to BFG predominated among the analyzed indicator microorganisms in HWW, and their copy numbers were similar to those of genes specific to E. coli and E. faecalis in the remaining samples. The abundance of genes specific to BFG was highly correlated with the abundance of genes characteristic of E. coli and E. faecalis, all analyzed ARGs and intI genes. The results of this study indicate that genes specific to BFG can be used in analyses of human fecal pollution, and as indicators of environmental contamination with ARGs. A significant increase in the copy numbers of genes specific to BFG, E. coli, and seven out of the 11 analyzed ARGs was noted in samples of river water collected downstream from the wastewater discharge point, which suggests that WWTPs are an important source of these genes in riparian environments.},

Results were calculated in cell equivalents per 100. ng of total DNA extracted from water samples and per 100. mL sample volume, which seems to underestimate the abundance of antibiotic resistance and opportunistic bacteria. High abundances of opportunistic bacteria and ARG were quantified in clinical wastewaters and influents of the adjacent WWTP. The removal capacities of WWTP were up to 99% for some, but not all investigated bacteria. The abundances of most ARG targets were found to be increased in the bacterial population after conventional wastewater treatment. As a consequence, downstream surface water and also some groundwater compartments displayed high abundances of all four ARGs. It became obvious that the dynamics of the ARG differed from the fate of the opportunistic bacteria. This underlines the necessity of an advanced microbial characterization of anthropogenically influenced environments.},

Water samples from influents and effluents of the sewage tank of an infectious diseases hospital and clinical strains collected from the intra-hospital infections, during a period of 10 days prior to wastewater sampling were analyzed. Antibiotic resistant K. pneumoniae strains from wastewaters were recovered on selective media. Based on antibiotic susceptibility profiles and PCR analyses of antibiotic resistance (AR) genetic background, as well as whole-genome sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) and subsequent bioinformatic analyses, 11 ST101 K. pneumoniae strains isolated from hospital wastewater influent, wastewater effluent and clinical sector were identified as clonally related. The SNP and core genome analyses pointed out that five strains were found to be closely related (with ≤18 SNPs and identical cgMLST profile). The strains belonging to this clone harbored multiple acquired AR genes [blaCTX–M–15, blaOXA–48, blaOXA–1, blaSHV–106, blaTEM–150, aac(3)-IIa, aac(6′)-Ib-cr, oqxA10, oqxB17, fosA, catB3, dfrA14, tet(D)] and chromosomal mutations involved in AR ($\Delta$mgrB, $\Delta$ompK35, amino acid substitutions in GyrA Ser83Tyr, Asp87Asn, ParC Ser80Tyr). Twenty-nine virulence genes involved in iron acquisition, biofilm and pili formation, adherence, and the type six secretion system – T6SS-III were identified.

abstract = {Due to the global progress of antimicrobial resistance, the World Health Organization (WHO) published the list of the antibiotic-resistant “priority pathogens” in order to promote research and development of new antibiotics to the families of bacteria that cause severe and often deadly infections. In the framework of the One Health approach, the surveillance of these pathogens in different environments should be implemented in order to analyze their spread and the potential risk of transmission of antibiotic resistances by food and water. Therefore, the objective of this work was to determine the presence of high and critical priority pathogens included in the aforementioned list in different aquatic environments in the POCTEFA area (North Spain–South France). In addition to these pathogens, detection of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae was included due its relevance as being the antibiotic of choice to treat infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria (MDR). From the total of 80 analyzed samples, 100% of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and collectors (from hospitals and slaughterhouses) and 96.4% of the rivers, carried antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) against the tested antibiotics. Fifty-five (17.7%) of the isolates were identified as target microorganisms (high and critical priority pathogens of WHO list) and 58.2% (n = 32) of them came from WWTPs and collectors. Phenotypic and genotypic characterization showed that 96.4% were MDR and resistance to penicillins/cephalosporins was the most widespread. The presence of bla genes, KPC-type carbapenemases, mcr-1 and vanB genes has been confirmed. In summary, the presence of clinically relevant MDR bacteria in the studied aquatic environments demonstrates the need to improve surveillance and treatments of wastewaters from slaughterhouses, hospitals and WWTPs, in order to minimize the dispersion of resistance through the effluents of these areas. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

abstract = {Background. Salmonella infections cause a disproportionately high number of deaths in Africa, especially among poor urban populations. The increasing level of multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections is a major cause of concern in these settings where alternative effective treatment is unavailable. Other options for management of these infections must be sought. The knowledge of hotspots in endemic settings can help to prioritize management and control measures in Kenya and the region. Methods. Using blood cultures, we investigated children presenting with fever of unknown origin for Salmonella infections. We performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole genome sequencing to further characterize Salmonella isolates. Using Global Positioning System technologies, we mapped Salmonella isolates to households of patients in the study site and determined risk factors associated with high concentration of cases in particular sites. Results. A total of 281 Salmonella species (149 from blood and 132 from fecal samples) from febrile children <5 years of age were studied. These consisted of 85 Salmonella Typhimurium, 58 Salmonella Enteritidis, 32 other nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) serotypes, and 126 Salmonella Typhi. The prevalence of MDR invasive NTS (iNTS) was 77.2%, with 15% resistant to ceftriaxone, a drug that is last-line treatment for iNTS and other severe gram-negative infections in Kenya. Invasive NTS and S. Typhi together mapped around common water vending points and close to sewer convergence points in the highly populated village. Conclusions. These hotspots could be targeted for management and control strategies, including a combined introduction of typhoid and iNTS vaccines, aimed at reducing transmission in these endemic settings.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a global phenomenon that has severe epidemiological ramifications world-wide. It has been suggested that antibiotics that have been discharged into the natural aquatic environments after usage or manufacture can promote the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). These environmental ARGs could serve as a reservoir and be horizontally transferred to human-associated bacteria and thus contribute to AR proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate the anthropogenic load of antibiotics in Northern Pakistan and study the occurrence of ARGs in selected samples from this region. 19 sampling sites were selected; including six rivers, one dam, one canal, one sewage drain and four drug formulation facilities. Our results show that five of the rivers have antibiotic levels comparable to surface water measurements in unpolluted sites in Europe and the US. However, high levels of antibiotics could be detected in the downstream river in close vicinity of the 10 million city Lahore, 1100, 1700 and 2700 ng L-1 for oxytetracycline, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole respectively. Highest detected levels were at one of the drug formulation facilities, with the measured levels of 1100, 4100, 6200, 7300, 8000, 27000, 28000 and 49000 ng L-1 of erythromycin, lincomycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, oxytetracycline, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole respectively. ARGs were also detected at the sites and the highest levels of ARGs detected, sulI and dfrA1, were directly associated with the antibiotics detected at the highest concentrations, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Highest levels of both antibiotics and ARGs were seen at a drug formulation facility, within an industrial estate with a low number of local residents and no hospitals in the vicinity, which indicates that the levels of ARGs at this site were associated with the environmental levels of antibiotics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Khan et al.},

abstract = {This study aims to investigate the prevalence of clinically relevant carbapenemases genes (blaKPC, blaNDM and blaOXA-48) in water samples collected over one-year period from hospital (H), raw and treated wastewater of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as well as along the Zenne River (Belgium). The genes were quantified in both particle-attached (PAB) and free-living (FLB) bacteria. Our results showed that absolute abundances were the highest in H waters. Although absolute abundances were significantly reduced in WWTP effluents, the relative abundance (normalized per 16S rRNA) was never lowered through wastewater treatment. Particularly, for the PAB the relative abundances were significantly higher in the effluents respect to the influents of both WWTPs for all the genes. The absolute abundances along the Zenne River increased from upstream to downstream, peaking after the release of WWTPs effluents, in both fractions. Our results demonstrated that blaKPC, blaNDM and blaOXA-48 are widely distributed in the Zenne as a consequence of chronic discharge from WWTPs. To conclude, the levels of carbapenemases genes are significantly lower than other genes conferring resistance to more widely used antibiotics (analyzed in previous studies carried out at the same sites), but could raise up to the levels of high prevalent resistance genes.},

In this study, the total bacterial load, the abundance of FIB (E. coli and Enterococcus spp. (ENT)), Pseudomonas spp. and ARGs (blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaSHV, blaNDM and aadA) were quantified using quantitative PCR in the total DNA extracted from the sediments recovered from hospital outlet pipes (HOP) and the Cauvery River Basin (CRB), Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India. The abundance of bacterial marker genes were 120, 104 and 89 fold higher for the E. coli, Enterococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp., respectively at HOP when compared with CRB. The ARGs aadA and blaTEM were most frequently detected in higher concentration than other ARGs at all the sampling sites. The ARGs blaSHV and blaNDM were identified in CRB sediments contaminated by hospital and urban wastewaters. The ARGs abundance strongly correlated (r ≥ 0.36, p < 0.05, n = 45) with total bacterial load and E. coli in the sediments, indicating a common origin and extant source of contamination. Tropical aquatic ecosystems receiving wastewaters can act as reservoir of ARGs, which could potentially be transferred to susceptible bacterial pathogens at these sites.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance has become a major health concern; thus, there is a growing interest in exploring the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment as well as the factors that contribute to their emergence. Aquatic ecosystems provide an ideal setting for the acquisition and spread of ARGs due to the continuous pollution by antimicrobial compounds derived from anthropogenic activities. We investigated, therefore, the pollution level of a broad range of antibiotics and ARGs released from hospital and urban wastewaters, their removal through a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and their presence in the receiving river. Several antimicrobial compounds were detected in all water samples collected. Among antibiotic families, fluoroquinolones were detected at the highest concentration, especially in hospital effluent samples. Although good removal efficiency by treatment processes was observed for several antimicrobial compounds, most antibiotics were still present in WWTP effluents. The results also revealed that copy numbers of ARGs, such as blaTEM (resistance to $\beta$-lactams), qnrS (reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones), ermB (resistance to macrolides), sulI (resistance to sulfonamides) and tetW (resistance to tetracyclines), were detected at the highest concentrations in hospital effluent and WWTP influent samples. Although there was a significant reduction in copy numbers of these ARGs in WWTP effluent samples, this reduction was not uniform across analyzed ARGs. Relative concentration of ermB and tetW genes decreased as a result of wastewater treatment, whereas increased in the case of blaTEM, sulI and qnrS genes. The incomplete removal of antibiotics and ARGs in WWTP severely affected the receiving river, where both types of emerging pollutants were found at higher concentration in downstream waters than in samples collected upstream from the discharge point. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a widespread occurrence of antibiotics and ARGs in urban and hospital wastewater and how these effluents, even after treatment, contribute to the spread of these emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment.},

abstract = {Contamination of environmental waters by extended-spectrum--lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (ESBLEC) is of great concern. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and hospitals release large amounts of ESBLEC into the environment. In the present study, we isolated ESBLEC strains from wastewater collected from a WWTP and a hospital in Japan and performed whole-genome sequencing to characterize these strains. Genomic analysis of 54 strains (32 from the WWTP and 22 from hospital wastewater) revealed the occurrence of clinically important clonal groups with extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli status in the WWTP and hospital wastewater. Fine-scale phylogenetic analysis was performed to further characterize 15 sequence type 131 (ST131) complex strains (11 from the WWTP and 4 from hospital wastewater). These ST131 complex strains were comprised of the following different subgroups: clade A (n 2), C1-M27 (n 8), and C1 (non-C1-M27) (n 1) for strains from the WWTP and clade A (n 2), C1-M27 (n 1), and C1 (non-C1-M27) (n 1) for strains from hospital wastewater. The results indicate that ESBLEC strains belonging to clinically important lineages, including the C1-M27 clade, may disseminate into the environment through wastewater, highlighting the need to monitor for antibiotic resistance in wastewater.},

Investigation of outbreaks of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) suggests that the environment serves as a significant reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, there is a paucity of data regarding the presence of ARGs in the water sources in South Africa. In this study, water samples collected from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), surface water and hospital sewage were screened for enterococci harbouring genes conferring resistance to four classes of antibiotics. Enterococci isolates harbouring ARGs were detected in raw influent and treated wastewater discharge from WWTPs and hospital sewage water. Plasmid and transposon encoded ermB (macrolide), tetM and tetL (tetracycline) as well as aph(3')-IIIa (aminoglycosides) genes were frequently detected among the isolates, especially in E. faecalis. The presence of enterococci harbouring ARGs in the treated wastewater suggest that ARGs are discharged into the environment where their proliferation could be perpetuated. Among the enterococci clonal complexes (CCs) recovered from wastewater were E. faecium CC17 (ST18), which is frequently associated with hospital outbreaks and a novel E. faecalis sequence type (ST), ST780.

Of 200 presumptive VRE isolates tested, 71 (35%) harbored vanA. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis allowed the detection of 26 subtypes, which were identified as Enterococcus faecium (n = 13), E. casseliflavus (n = 6), E. mundtii (n = 3), E. faecalis (n = 3), and E. durans (n = 1) by phenotypic tests and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Long PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (L-PCR-RFLP) analysis of Tn1546-like elements and PCR analysis of internal regions revealed the presence of seven groups among the 29 strains studied. The most common group (group 1) corresponded to the structure of Tn1546 in the prototype strain E. faecium BM4147. Two novel L-PCR-RFLP patterns (groups 3 and 4) were found for E. casseliflavus strains. Indistinguishable Tn1546-like elements occurred in VRE strains belonging to different species or originating from different sources. Interspecies plasmid-mediated transfer of vancomycin resistance to E. faecium BM4105 was demonstrated for E. faecalis, E. mundtii, and E. durans. This study indicates that VRE, including species other than E. faecium and E. faecalis, are widespread in nature and in environments that are not exposed to vancomycin selection and not heavily contaminated with feces, such as seawater, blue mussels, and nonagricultural soil. Tn1546-like elements can readily transfer between enterococci of different species and ecological origins, therefore raising questions about the origin of these transposable elements and their possible transfer between environmental and clinical settings.},

abstract = {Objectives: Effluents contain a diverse abundance of antibiotic resistance genes that augment the resistome of receiving aquatic environments. However, uncertainty remains regarding their temporal persistence, transcription and response to anthropogenic factors, such as antibiotic usage. We present a spatiotemporal study within a river catchment (River Cam, UK) that aims to determine the contribution of antibiotic resistance genecontaining effluents originating from sites of varying antibiotic usage to the receiving environment. Methods: Gene abundance in effluents (municipal hospital and dairy farm) was compared against background samples of the receiving aquatic environment (i.e. the catchment source) to determine the resistome contribution of effluents. We used metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to correlate DNA and RNA abundance and identified differentially regulated gene transcripts. Results: We found thatmean antibiotic resistance gene and transcript abundances were correlated for both hospital ($\rho$=0.9, two-tailed P < 0.0001) and farm ($\rho$=0.5, two-tailed P < 0.0001) effluents and that two $\beta$-lactam resistance genes (blaGES and blaOXA)were overexpressed in all hospital effluent samples. High $\beta$-lactam resistance gene transcript abundancewas related to hospital antibiotic usage over timeand hospital effluents contained antibiotic residues. Conclusions: We conclude that effluents contribute high levels of antibiotic resistance genes to the aquatic environment; these genes are expressed at significant levels and are possibly related to the level of antibiotic usage at the effluent source.},

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at The Children's Hospital and The Institute of Child Health, Lahore from July to December 2015. The faecal specimens from healthy individuals, patients, sewage sludge, cattle, chickens and raw meat (n = 122) were processed for microbiological analysis using MacConkey agar supplemented with cefotaxime. The identification of organisms was confirmed by API 10S and antimicrobial resistance profile was recorded by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Results: On the basis of screening, 77 (63.0%) specimens were found to be positive for ESBL production. The confirmation of 74 (60.0%) ESBL producing E. coli was done using double disc synergy test (DDST). The frequency of ESBL producing E. coli was found to be 17 (57.0%) in healthy individuals, 15 (53.0%) in patients, 10 (66.0%) in cattle faeces, 5 (71.0%) in sewage sludge, 14 (70.0%) in raw meat and 13 (59.0%) in chicken faeces. All of these isolates were resistant to cephalosporins and some of these were resistant to fluoroquinolones and meropenem. None of the isolates showed resistance to cefoperazone-sulbactam, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin. Conclusion: The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli was recorded in all the environments, suggesting a global expansion of these enzymes.},

abstract = {In recent years, some novel antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have shown more severe health risks than traditional ARGs because of their easy transmission and broad drug resistance. These emerging ARGs have received extensive attention in clinical health, but little research on the environmental impacts of them is conducted. This study examined the contamination characteristics of two typical emerging ARGs, MCR-1 and NDM-1. Quantitative PCR (QPCR) was used to explore the distribution of the two ARGs in the downstream of the Yangtze River (Nanjing section) and nearby wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). Redundancy analysis (RDA) was then adopted to evaluate the influence of water quality indicators on the distribution of the ARGs. The results showed that: (1) In the WWTPs, high concentrations of MCR-1 and NDM-1 in the plant influent were detected and the concentrations decreased in the wastewater treatment processes. The total removal efficiencies were 92.5% and 92.7% for the two ARGs respectively, but the concentrations still reached 2.5×108 and 7.0×106 copies/L in the effluent. (2) In the Yangtze River (Nanjing section), the concentration of the two ARGS were 8.5×107-3.5×109 and 4.3×105-2.1×207 copies/L respectively, which decreased with the direction of water flow, but increased abnormally at some sampling sites, which could be attributed to the anthropogenic pollutions in the area. (3) In the DWTPs, the removal efficiencies of the two ARGs were 75.0% and 70.6% respectively, but the concentrations of the ARGs were 1.4×107 and 6.3×104 copies/L of in the treated water. They were also greatly enriched in the sludge. (4) The concentration of MCR-1 was positively correlated with CODCr, NH3-N and Turbidity. By comparison, NDM-1 was only weakly correlated with turbidity, but showed no significant correlation with other water quality indicators. The study indicated that the wastewater treatment processes could not effectively remove MCR-1 and NDM-1. A large amount of ARGs was discharged into the Yangtze River (Nanjing section) through the effluent. The Yangtze River (Nianjing section) with high concentration of the ARGs was used by the DWTPs as the source of drinking water, and the residual ARGs in the treated drinking water could cause great ecological and health risks.},

abstract = {Introduction: The occurrence of antibiotic resistance in faecal bacteria in sewage is likely to reflect the current local clinical resistance situation. Aim: This observational study investigated the relationship between Escherichia coli resistance rates in sewage and clinical samples representing the same human populations. Methods: E. coli were isolated from eight hospital (n = 721 isolates) and six municipal (n = 531 isolates) sewage samples, over 1 year in Gothenburg, Sweden. An inexpensive broth screening method was validated against disk diffusion and applied to determine resistance against 11 antibiotics in sewage isolates. Resistance data on E. coli isolated from clinical samples from corresponding local hospital and primary care patients were collected during the same year and compared with those of the sewage isolates by linear regression. Results: E. coli resistance rates derived from hospital sewage and hospital patients strongly correlated (r2 = 0.95 for urine and 0.89 for blood samples), as did resistance rates in E. coli from municipal sewage and primary care urine samples (r2 = 0.82). Resistance rates in hospital sewage isolates were close to those in hospital clinical isolates while resistance rates in municipal sewage isolates were about half of those measured in primary care isolates. Resistance rates in municipal sewage isolates were more stable between sampling occasions than those from hospital sewage. Conclusion: Our findings provide support for development of a low-cost, sewage-based surveillance system for antibiotic resistance in E. coli, which could complement current monitoring systems and provide clinically relevant antibiotic resistance data for countries and regions where surveillance is lacking.},

In this study, E. coli isolates were recovered from residential, industrial, agricultural, hospital wastewaters and recreational waters and, further characterized according to diarrheagenic potential, phylotyping and antimicrobial resistance phenotype. Among the total 178 E. coli isolates, antimicrobial resistance was detected in 37% to at least one of the 11 antimicrobials tested. The highest percentage of resistant E. coli was recovered from agricultural wastewaters (57.7%) followed by recreational waters (56.4%), hospital (34.5%), residential (22.7%) and industrial wastewaters (22.2%). Twenty-three resistance profiles (I-XXIII) were detected and 17 isolates exhibited the MDR phenotype. 11.2% of the total E. coli isolates carried diarrheagenic markers: astA (7.3%, 13/178), stx1 (2.8%, 05/178), escV (2.2%, 04/178) and estIa (0.6%, 01/178).

Between 2012 and 2013, we investigated NTS sources and transmission in Kampala. We detected Salmonella in 60% of the influent and 60% of the effluent samples from a wastewater treatment plant and 53.3% of the influent and 10% of the effluent samples from waste stabilization ponds that serve the human population; 40.9%of flush-water samples from ruminant slaughterhouses, 6.6% of the poultry fecal samples from live bird markets and 4% of the fecal samples from swine at slaughter; and in 54.2% of the water samples from a channel that drains storm-water and effluents from the city. We obtained 775 Salmonella isolates, identified 32 serovars, and determined resistance to 15 antimicrobials. We genotyped common serovars using multiple-locus variable number tandem repeats analysis or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition, we analyzed 49 archived NTS isolates from asymptomatic livestock and human clinical cases. Salmonella from ruminant and swine sources were mostly pan-susceptible (95%) while poultry isolates were generally more resistant. Salmonella Kentucky isolated from poultry exhibited extensive drug resistance characterized by resistance to 10 antimicrobials. Interestingly, similar genotypes of S. Kentucky but with less antimicrobial resistance (AMR) were found in poultry, human and environmental sources. The observed AMR patterns could be attributed to host or management factors associated with production. Alternatively, S. Kentucky may be prone to acquiring AMR. The factors driving AMR remain poorly understood and should be elucidated. Overall, shared genotypes and AMR phenotypes were found in NTS from human, livestock and environmental sources, suggesting zoonotic and environmental transmissions most likely occur. Information from this study could be used to control NTS transmission.},

abstract = {The occurrence and diversity of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in wastewaters from the Brighton and Hove area of south-east England were investigated. VRE were recovered from 71% of raw urban wastewater samples, 22% of treated urban wastewater samples, 15% of hospital wastewater sample and 33% of farm wastewater samples. Two hundred and eighty-eight isolates were typed and identified and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to six antibiotics were determined for selected VRE. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) strains with a vancomycin MIC of more than 32 $\mu$g ml-1 were examined by polymerase chain reaction for the vanA, vanB and esp genes. Twenty-three VREF with the vanA or vanB gene were further analysed by multilocus sequence typing which revealed that a cluster of VREF from both hospital and urban wastewaters belonged to the high-risk, epidemic, clonal complex-17 (CC17). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium belonging to the CC17 group contained the purK-1 allele, were resistant to ampicillin and frequently ciprofloxacin, and usually contained the esp gene. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of CC17 strains isolated from urban wastewaters in the UK, and indicates that certain clones carrying antibiotic resistance or virulence traits indicative of the hospital environment can be detected in the urban wastewater system. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {Background: There is little information available in Chile on the distribution of Enterococcus spp in waste water and its implications in transmission of antibiotic resistance through the water cycle. Enterococcus spp are common in nosocomial infections and may spread antibiotic resistance through the food chain. Aim: To determine the presence of antibiotic resistant Enterococcus spp in the sewage of Antofagasta, Chile. Material and Methods: Samples of sewage from two sewage treatment plants and from the Public Hospital of Antofagasta collector were obtained. Enterococcus spp were isolated on m-Enterococcus agar containing ampicillin, vancomycin and streptomycin. The isolates were identified and subjected to biochemical typing (PhPlate). Minimal inhibitory concentration determination was performed by agar dilution technique. Results: High counts of resistant Enterococcus spp were found on the streptomycin plates, lower on ampicillin and very low on vancomycin plates. A total of 63 Enterococcus spp strains were typed and the identification showed 5 different species; E faecalis (65%), E faecium (14%), E hirae (13%), E durans (6%) and E gallinarum (2%). The typing revealed a high diversity among the isolates. Two biochemical phenotypes were predominant, C1 (21 strains) and C6 (7 strains). Both were highly resistant to gentamycin and streptomycin; moderately resistant to ampicillin, cloramphenicol, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin, and with intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin. Both phenotypes were found in the sewage of the hospital collector and in the treatment plants. Conclusions: In the sewage of Antofagasta we found dominating phenotypes of multiresistant Enterococcus spp. Sewage could be an important way of transmission of these microorganisms.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance continues to be an emerging threat both in clinical and environmental settings. Among the many causes, the impact of postchlorinated human wastewater on antibiotic resistance has not been well studied. Our study compared antibiotic susceptibility among Aeromonas spp. in postchlorinated effluents to that of the recipient riverine populations for three consecutive years against 12 antibiotics. Aeromonas veronii and Aeromonas hydrophila predominated among both aquatic environments, although greater species diversity was evident in treated wastewater. Overall, treated wastewater contained a higher prevalence of nalidixic acid-, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT)-, and tetracycline-resistant isolates, as well as multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates compared to upstream surface water. After selecting for tetracycline-resistant strains, 34.8% of wastewater isolates compared to 8.3% of surface water isolates were multidrug resistant, with nalidixic acid, streptomycin, and SXT being the most common. Among tetracycline-resistant isolates, efflux pump genes tetE and tetA were the most prevalent, though stronger resistance correlated with tetA. Over 50% of river and treated wastewater isolates exhibited cytotoxicity that was significantly correlated with serine protease activity, suggesting many MDR strains from effluent have the potential to be pathogenic. These findings highlight that conventionally treated wastewater remains a reservoir of resistant, potentially pathogenic bacterial populations being introduced into aquatic systems that could pose a threat to both the environment and public health. IMPORTANCE Aeromonads are Gram-negative, asporogenous rod-shaped bacteria that are autochthonous in fresh and brackish waters. Their pathogenic nature in poikilotherms and mammals, including humans, pose serious environmental and public health concerns especially with rising levels of antibiotic resistance. Wastewater treatment facilities serve as major reservoirs for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and resistant bacterial populations and are, thus, a potential major contributor to resistant populations in aquatic ecosystems. However, few longitudinal studies exist analyzing resistance among human wastewater effluents and their recipient aquatic environments. In this study, considering their ubiquitous nature in aquatic environments, we used Aeromonas spp. as bacterial indicators of environmental antimicrobial resistance, comparing it to that in postchlorinated wastewater effluents over 3 years. Furthermore, we assessed the potential of these resistant populations to be pathogenic, thus elaborating on their potential public health threat.},

abstract = {Members of the genus Aeromonas are recognized carriers of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments. However, their importance on the spread of resistance from hospital effluents to the environment is poorly understood. Quinolone resistant Aeromonas spp. (n=112) isolated from hospital effluent (HE) and from raw (RWW) and treated wastewater (TWW) of the receiving urban wastewater treatment plant (UWTP) were characterized. Species identification and genetic intraspecies diversity were assessed based on the 16S rRNA, cpn60 and gyrB genes sequence analysis. The antibiotic resistance phenotypes and genotypes (qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, qnrS, qnrVC; qepA; oqxAB; aac(6')-Ib-cr; blaOXA; incU) were analyzed in function of the origin and taxonomic group. Most isolates belonged to the species Aeromonas caviae and Aeromonas hydrophila (50% and 41%, respectively). The quinolone and the beta-lactamase resistance genes aac(6')-Ib-cr and blaOXA, including gene blaOXA-101, identified for the first time in Aeromonas spp., were detected in 58% and 56% of the isolates, respectively, with identical prevalence in HE and UWTP wastewater. In contrast, the gene qnrS2 was observed mainly in isolates from the UWTP (51%) and rarely in HE isolates (3%), suggesting that its origin is not the clinical setting. Bacterial groups and genes that allow the identification of major routes of antibiotic resistance dissemination are valuable tools to control this problem. In this study, it was concluded that members of the genus Aeromonas harboring the genes aac(6')-Ib-cr and blaOXA are relevant tracers of antibiotic resistance dissemination in wastewater habitats, while those yielding the gene qnrS2 allow the traceability from non-clinical sources.},

The occurrence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in wastewater and aquatic environments is an indication of MDR bacteria in the community. This study evaluated CPE in aquatic environments and compared them to the local hospital isolates in Sweden. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of antibiotic resistance of environmental and clinical CPE were performed. The relatedness of the isolates and possible clonal dissemination was evaluated using phylogenetic and phyloproteomic analysis. Klebsiella oxytoca carrying carbapenemase genes (blaVIM-1, blaIMP-29) were isolated from wastewater and the recipient river, while K. oxytoca (blaVIM-1) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (blaVIM-1, blaOXA-48, blaNDM-1, blaKPC-3) were isolated from patients at the local clinics or hospital. The K. oxytoca classified as sequence type 172 (ST172) isolated from the river was genotypically related to two clinical isolates recovered from patients. The similarity between environmental and clinical isolates suggests the dispersion of blaVIM-1 producing K. oxytoca ST172 from hospital to aquatic environment and the likelihood of its presence in the community. This is the first report of CPE in aquatic environments in Sweden; therefore, surveillance of aquatic and hospital environments for CPE in other urban areas is important to determine the major transfer routes in order to formulate strategies to prevent the spread of MDR bacteria.},

abstract = {Role of residual antibiotics in aquatic environment on the selection and
diffusion of bacterial resistances of Aeromonas, Acinetobacter and
Legionella. - Antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotics are
discharged in various amounts in the environment as a result of the
increasing and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics in medical
veterinary and agricultural practices. Surface waters are the main
receptacle for these pollutants and are the major source of water
directly or indirectly used for human and animal consumption.
The aim of this study, carried out within the National Research Program
49 ``Antibiotic Resistance{''}, was to evaluate the role of residual
antibiotic compounds in water on emergence and persistence of resistant
bacteria. Research was focused on three bacterial genera, Aeromonas,
Acinetobacter, and Legionella, largely diffused in the aquatic
environment and showing pathogenic properties towards human beings and
animals, and three antibiotic families (beta-lactams, quinolones /
fluoroquinolones and macrolides) mainly used in human medicine.
Phenotypic resistance analysis in various aquatic environments has
highlighted the presence of resistant stains in the most contaminated
waters. Aeromonas resistant to the fourth generation cephalosporins
could be isolated from hospital waste waters and from waste water
treatment plants, while clinical strains proved to be more susceptible.
On the contrary, environmental Acinetobacter were more susceptible than
those of clinical origin. For Legionella strains, MIC values were
different according to the genetic type (Sequence-based Type) and not
according to the origin. A significant correlation between
concentrations of antibiotic compounds measured and resistant Aeromonas
and Acinetobacter strains was highlighted in hospital waste waters.
Finally, the diffusion of class 1 integrons, genetic and mobile element,
in Aeromonas strains isolated from various aquatic environments were
evaluated and correlated with their origin.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance surveillance data is lacking in many parts of the world, limiting effective therapy and management of resistance development. Analysis of urban wastewater, which contains bacteria from thousands of individuals, opens up possibilities to generate informative surveillance data in a standardized and resource-efficient way. Here, we evaluate the relationship between antibiotic resistance prevalence in E. coli from wastewater and clinical samples by studying countries with different resistance situations as assessed by traditional clinical surveillance. Composite, influent wastewater samples were collected over 24 h from treatment plants serving major cities in ten European countries. Using a broth screening method, resistance to six antibiotic classes was analyzed for 2507 E. coli isolates (n = 247–252 per country). Resistance prevalence in wastewater E. coli was compared to that in clinical E. coli reported by the European Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Network. Resistance prevalence was lower in wastewater than clinical E. coli but followed similar geographic trends. Significant relationships were found for resistance to aminopenicillins (R2 = 0.72, p = 0.0019) and fluoroquinolones (R2 = 0.62, p = 0.0072), but not for aminoglycosides (R2 = 0.13, p = 0.31) and third-generation cephalosporins (R2 = 0.00, p = 0.99) where regression analyses were based on considerably fewer resistant isolates. When all four antibiotic classes were taken into account, the relationship was strong (R2 = 0.85, p < 0.0001). Carbapenem resistance was rare in both wastewater and clinical isolates. Wastewater monitoring shows promise as method for generating surveillance data reflecting the clinical prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Such data may become especially valuable in regions where clinical surveillance is currently limited. Two-line summary: Wastewater monitoring shows promise as method for generating surveillance data reflecting the clinical prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria.},

abstract = {The resistance patterns of Escherichia coli in untreated (raw) urban wastewater (UW) was monitored by repeated sampling during 1 year. Comparison with data from wastewater samples collected from hospital wastewater (HW) in the same urban area was made. A total of 1326 E. coli isolates from 17 UW samples and 451 isolates from six HW samples were analysed by typing using the PhenePlate™ system, and their susceptibility towards 10 antibiotics was determined. Resistance to at least one antibiotic was observed in 34% of the UW isolates and 55% of the HW isolates. For UW isolates, phenotypic diversity was lower among antibiotic-susceptible than among antibiotic-resistant isolates, indicating a higher presence of clonal groups among susceptible isolates. Total antibiotic resistance measured as the Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index was 0.08 for UW compared with 0.19 for HW, and increased over time for UW isolates, indicating increasing resistance among E. coli in the urban population during the studied time period. Resistance to all included $\beta$-lactam antibiotics was detected in 2.4% of UW isolates and 14.0% of HW isolates, and 73/75 (97%) analysed isolates were confirmed to be extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (including plasmid-mediated AmpC)-producing E. coli. Thus, by cultivating samples from wastewater and analysing many independent isolates per sample, increasing frequencies of antibiotic resistance in UW were detected during 1 year that may reflect increasing faecal carriage of resistant bacteria in the society. Surveillance of antibiotic resistance in wastewater could be a valuable tool for screening of resistance trends on a population level.},

In this study, the concentrations of 25 antimicrobials, the resistance of Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains in response to the selection pressure imposed by 15 antimicrobials, and enrichment of 20 ARGs in E. coli isolated from hospital wastewaters and surface waters were investigated from 2016 to 2018. In hospital wastewaters, clarithromycin was detected at the highest concentration followed by sulfamethoxazole and sulfapyridine. Approximately 80% of the E. coli isolates were resistant, while 14% of the isolates exhibited intermediate resistance against the tested antimicrobial agents. Approximately 61% of the examined isolates were categorized as multidrug-resistant bacteria. The overall abundance of phenotypes that were resistant toward drugs was in the following order: $\beta$-lactams, tetracycline, quinolones, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, aminoglycosides, and chloramphenicol. The data showed that the E. coli isolates frequently harbored blaTEM, blaCTX-M, tetA, qnrS, and sul2. These results indicated that personal care products were significantly associated with the presence of several resistant phenotypes and resistance genes, implying their role in co-association with multidrug resistance. Statistical analysis also indicated a disparity specific to the site, treatment, and year in the data describing the prevalence of ARB and ARGs and their release into downstream waters. This study provides novel insights into the abundance of antimicrobial, ARB and ARGs in Sri Lanka, and could further offer invaluable information that can be integrated into global antimicrobial resistance databases.},

abstract = {Anaerobic bacteria of the genus Bacteroides are a large group of commensal microorganisms that colonize the human and animal digestive tract. The genus Bacteroides and the closely related genus Parabacteroides include the Bacteroides fragilis group (BFG) of potentially pathogenic bacteria which are frequently isolated from patients with anaerobic infections. The aim of this study was to assess the antimicrobial resistance of environmental strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Strains were isolated from human feces, hospital wastewater, influent (UWW) and effluent (TWW) wastewater from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and from the feces of lab rats as a negative control to monitor the entire route of transmission of BFG strains from humans to the environment. The resistance of 123 environmental BFG strains to six antibiotic groups was analyzed with the use of culture-dependent methods. Additionally, the presence of 25 genes encoding antibiotic resistance was determined by PCR. The analyzed environmental BFG strains were highly resistant to the tested antibiotics. The percentage of resistant strains differed between the analyzed antibiotics and was determined at 97.56% for ciprofloxacin, 49.59% for erythromycin, 44.71% for ampicillin, 35.77% for tetracycline, 32.52% for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 26.83% for chloramphenicol, 26.01% for clindamycin, 11.38% for moxifloxacin, and 8.94% for metronidazole. The highest drug-resistance levels were observed in the strains isolated from UWW and TWW samples. The mechanisms of antibiotic-resistance were determined in phenotypically resistant strains of BFG. Research has demonstrated the widespread presence of genes encoding resistance to chloramphenicol (100% of all chloramphenicol-resistant strains), tetracyclines (97.78% of all tetracycline-resistant strains), macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins (81.97% of all erythromycin-resistant strains). Genes encoding resistance to $\beta$-lactams and fluoroquinolones were less prevalent. None of the metronidazole-resistant strains harbored the gene encoding resistance to nitroimidazoles. BFG strains isolated from UWW and TWW samples were characterized by the highest diversity of antibiotic-resistance genes and were most often drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant. The present study examines the potential negative consequences of drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant BFG strains that are evacuated with treated wastewater into the environment. The transmission of these bacteria to surface water bodies can pose potential health threats for humans and animals; therefore, the quality of treated wastewater should be strictly monitored.},

abstract = {The Pseudomonas aeruginosa-containing wastewater released by hospitals is treated by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), generating sludge, which is used as a fertilizer, and effluent, which is discharged into rivers. We evaluated the risk of dissemination of antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa (AR-PA) from the hospital to the environment via the wastewater network. Over a 10-week period, we sampled weekly 11 points (hospital and urban wastewater, untreated and treated water, sludge) of the wastewater network and the river upstream and downstream of the WWTP of a city in eastern France. We quantified the P. aeruginosa load by colony counting. We determined the susceptibility to 16 antibiotics of 225 isolates, which we sorted into three categories (wild-type, antibiotic-resistant and multidrug-resistant). Extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBLs) and metallo-$\beta$-lactamases (MBLs) were identified by gene sequencing. All non-wild-type isolates (n = 56) and a similar number of wild-type isolates (n = 54) were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. Almost all the samples (105/110, 95.5%) contained P. aeruginosa, with high loads in hospital wastewater and sludge (≥3×106 CFU/l or/kg). Most of the multidrug-resistant isolates belonged to ST235, CC111 and ST395. They were found in hospital wastewater and some produced ESBLs such as PER-1 and MBLs such as IMP-29. The WWTP greatly reduced P. aeruginosa counts in effluent, but the P. aeruginosa load in the river was nonetheless higher downstream than upstream from the WWTP. We conclude that the antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa released by hospitals is found in the water downstream from the WWTP and in sludge, constituting a potential risk of environmental contamination. {\textcopyright} 2012 Slekovec et al.},

abstract = {The emergence and dissemination of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) are of great concern worldwide, as there are limited options for their treatment. Thus, in this study, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was applied to assess CRKP distribution and dissemination from hospital settings to the aquatic environment in order to identify the extent of the problem. Samples were collected from hospital wastewaters and receiving water bodies. Susceptible K. pneumoniae and CRKP were enumerated and isolated using standard methods. Seventeen CRKP were DNA-sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq X™ platform. De novo assembly and annotation were performed using SPAdes and RAST, respectively. The study analysed antibiotic resistance traits (antibiotic resistant genes, mobile genetic elements, and virulence genes) in CRKP isolates. Although influent of wastewater harboured the highest CRKP, wastewater treatment plants were efficient in reducing the threat. In terms of resistance per matrix, benthic sediment proved to harbour more CRKP (22.88%) versus susceptible K. pneumoniae, as revealed by their resistant quotient analysis, while effluent of wastewaters (4.21%) and water bodies (4.64%) had the lowest CRKP loads. The disseminating CRKP consisted of six sequence types (ST) - ST307 (n = 7), a novel ST3559 (n = 5), ST15 (n = 2), and one isolate of each of ST39, 152 and 298. All CRKP isolates harboured $\beta$-lactams (blaCTX-M-15 and blaOXA-1), quinolone (oqxA and oqxB) and fosfomycin (fosA) resistance genes as well as virulence genes. This study highlights the dissemination of ‘high' importance and novel ST CRKP from hospital wastewater to waterbodies. This is concerning, particularly in the African context where a sizable number of people still rely on direct water resources for household use, including drinking. Further research is needed to systematically track the occurrence and distribution of these bacteria so as to mitigate their threat.},

The aim of the study was to monitor and explore the epidemiology of this important hospital pathogen in the second largest clinical university hospital in Croatia. The presence of A. baumannii in hospital wastewater, as a route for possible transmission outside of the hospital setting, as well as its survival in environmental conditions including seawater, was investigated. During the examination period, ten both carbapenem and multidrug-resistant isolates of A. baumannii were recovered from hospital wastewater and compared to the clinical isolates originating from the same monitoring period. Multiplex PCR confirmed that four wastewater isolates harboured blaOXA-23-like, while five wastewater isolates harboured blaOXA-40-like genes sharing 100% sequence identity with blaOXA-72 sequence described in the same hospital in 2009, confirming the presence of an endemic cluster. Survival of A. baumannii in natural seawater was examined during 50 days of monitoring and to the best of our knowledge, was performed for the first time.},

abstract = {Vancomycin is an important antibiotic to treat serious nosocomial enterococci infections. Human activities, in particular those related with clinical practices performed in hospitals, can potentiate the transfer and selection of clinically-relevant resistant bacteria such as vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). Indeed, previous studies demonstrated the occurrence of VRE in urban wastewater treatment plants and related environments (e.g. sewage, rivers). In this study, the occurrence of VRE in a hospital effluent and in the receiving urban wastewater treatment plant was investigated. Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria occurred in the hospital effluent and in raw municipal inflow at densities of 103 to 102CFUmL-1, being significantly more prevalent in the hospital effluent than in the urban wastewater. Most of the VRE isolated from the hospital effluent belonged to the species Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and presented multidrug-resistance phenotypes to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and high-level gentamicin. The same pattern was observed in clinical isolates and in enterococci isolated from the final effluent of the urban wastewater treatment plant. These results show that hospital effluents discharged into urban wastewater treatment plants may be a relevant source of resistance spread to the environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are pathogens of increasing medical importance. In Brno, Czech Republic, we collected 37 samples from the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), 21 surface swabs from hospital settings, and 59 fecal samples from hospitalized patients and staff. Moreover, we collected 284 gull cloacal swabs from the colony situated 35 km downstream the WWTP. Samples were cultured selectively. Enterococci were identified using MALDI-TOF MS, phenotypically tested for susceptibility to antibiotics, and by PCR for occurrence of resistance and virulence genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were used to examine genotypic diversity. VRE carrying the vanA gene were found in 32 (86%, n = 37) wastewater samples, from which we obtained 49 isolates: Enterococcus faecium (44) and Enterococcus gallinarum (2), Enterococcus casseliflavus (2), and Enterococcus raffinosus (1). From 33 (69%) of 48 inpatient stool samples, we obtained 39 vanA-carrying VRE, which belonged to E. faecium (33 isolates), Enterococcus faecalis (4), and Enterococcus raffinosus (2). Nearly one-third of the samples from hospital surfaces contained VRE with the vanA gene. VRE were not detected among gulls. Sixty-seven (84%, n = 80) E. faecium isolates carried virulence genes hyl and/or esp. Virulence of E. faecalis was encoded by gelE, asa1, and cylA genes. A majority of the E. faecium isolates belonged to the clinically important sequence types ST17 (WWTP: 10 isolates; hospital: 4 isolates), ST18 (9;8), and ST78 (5;0). The remaining isolates belonged to ST555 (2;0), ST262 (1;6), ST273 (3;0), ST275 (1;0), ST549 (2;0), ST19 (0;1), ST323 (3;0), and ST884 (7;17). Clinically important enterococci carrying the vanA gene were almost continually detectable in the effluent of the WWTP, indicating insufficient removal of VRE during wastewater treatment and permanent shedding of these antibiotic resistant pathogens into the environment from this source. This represents a risk of their transmission to the environment.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli is simultaneously an indicator of water contamination and a human pathogen. This study aimed to characterize the virulence and resistance of E. coli from municipal and hospital wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in central Portugal. From a total of 193 isolates showing reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime and/or nalidixic acid, 20 E. coli with genetically distinct fingerprint profiles were selected and characterized. Resistance to antimicrobials was determined using the disc diffusion method. Extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamase and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, phylogroups, pathogenicity islands (PAIs) and virulence genes were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). CTX-M producers were typed by multilocus sequence typing. Resistance to beta-lactams was associated with the presence of blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-32. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance was associated with qnrA, qnrS and aac(60)-Ib-cr. Aminoglycoside resistance and multidrug-resistant phenotypes were also detected. PAI IV<inf>536</inf>, PAI II<inf>CFT073</inf>, PAI II<inf>536</inf> and PAI I<inf>CFT073</inf>, and uropathogenic genes iutA, papAH and sfa/foc were detected. With regard to the clinical ST131 clone, it carried bla<inf>CTX-M-15</inf>, bla<inf>TEM-type</inf>, qnrS and aac(60)-lb-cr; IncF and IncP plasmids, and virulence factors PAI IV<inf>536</inf>, PAI I<inf>CFT073</inf>, PAI II<inf>CFT073</inf>, iutA, sfa/foc and papAH were identified in the effluent of a hospital plant.

Pathogenicity of extended-spectrum P-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae isolates recovered from wastewater, 52 from hospital effluents and 32 from municipal wastewater-treatment-plant, was assessed by screening for 25 virulence factors, comparing results with those of 43 ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae clinical isolates. In hospital effluents/wastewater-treatmentplant/clinical isolates, rates of types 1 and 3 adhesins genes were of 100%/100%/100% and 100%/96.9%/100%, respectively, while non-fimbrialadhesin gene cf9awas absent. Rates of enterobactin, yersiniabactin, salmochelinand aerobactin genes were of 98.1%/100%/100%, 15.4%/12.5%/39.5%, 0%/3.1%/2.3% and 0%/0%/4.6%, respectively. No wastewater isolates had hypermucoviscosity phenotype and associated genes magA and rmpA, while a clinical isolate had hypermucoviscosity phenotype and rmpA. All isolates had a capsule and capsule/lipopolysaccharide-associated genes wabG and uge, and showed biofilm formation and serum resistance. Urease, colibactin and hemolysin a genes were at rates of 100%/100%/100%, 0%/3.1%/4.6% and 0%/0%/0%. Overall, prevalences of virulence factors in wastewater and clinical isolates were close. Yersiniabactin, wabG and ESBL genes were located on IncFII plasmid, in a wastewater isolate. Combination of virulence factors allowed to distinguish 6 virulence profiles among wastewater isolates, whose pathogenicity was confirmed in mice. Molecular typing showed genetic diversity and no direct epidemiological relatedness between wastewater and clinical isolates; however, phylogroups and sequence-types previously reported in clinical isolates were detected in wastewater isolates. The study highlighted the pathogenicity of wastewater K. pneumoniae, comparable to clinical isolates and potential role of wastewater as reservoir of virulent Klebsiella and virulence genes into natural environments.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the number of both extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) present in the inflow (hospital and urban sewage) and effluent waste water treatment plant (WWPT) and receiving waters. The results show that the average counts of ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae in hospital sewage were much higher (more than 2.5 logs) than those observed in urban waste water. On the other hand, the sewage treatment plant studied did not perform well in removing pathogenic microorganisms. Although Enterobacteriaceae concentrations were reduced in the final effluent by almost two log units as compared with the crude sewage concentrations, a high number of Enterobacteriaceae were detected in the effluent, representing a risk for microbiological pollution of water resources. A strong increase in ESBL-producing bacteria in the receiving water was detected after effluent discharge WWPT. The results obtained have also demonstrated that the hospital sewage releases a high concentration of VRE (> 3.0 × 105 CFU/100 ml), which represents 25% of the total population of enterococci presents in these waters. The hospital sewage contains a proportion of VRE 10 times higher in comparison with that detected in the urban sewage. The VRE proportion in the urban sewage was very low (2.6%) and constant along the different samplings. In the other hand, sewage discharged from municipal sewage treatment plant effluent also increased the VRE proportion in the river Sar water (1.5% of EVR in upstream to 3.8% downstream from the plant). In conclusion, sewage (particularly hospital sewage) contains a high proportion of ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae and vancomycin resistant enterococci, implying a potential risk of spreading these resistant bacteria and resistance genes to the environment and possibly to the human and animal population. {\textcopyright} 2010 WIT Press.},

abstract = {Background. The determinants of the spread of extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBLEC) in the community remain unclear. To evaluate its dissemination in the environment, we analyzed the ESBLEC population throughout an urban wastewater network.Methods. Samples were collected weekly, over a 10-week period, from 11 sites throughout the wastewater network of Besan{\c{c}}on city (France). Total E. coli and ESBLEC loads were determined for each sample. As a control, we analyzed 51 clinical ESBLEC isolates collected at our hospital. We genotyped both environmental and clinical ESBLEC by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing and identified their blaESBL genes by sequencing.Results. The E. coli load was higher in urban wastewater than in hospital wastewater (7.5 × 105 vs 3.5 × 105 CFU/mL, respectively). ESBLEC was recovered from almost all the environmental samples and accounted for 0.3% of total E. coli in the untreated water upstream from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The ESBLEC load was higher in hospital wastewater than in community wastewater (27 × 103 vs 0.8 × 103 CFU/mL, respectively). Treatment by the WWTP eliminated 98% and 94% of total E. coli and ESBLEC, respectively. The genotyping revealed considerable diversity within both environmental and clinical ESBLEC and the overrepresentation of some clonal complexes. Most of the sequence types displayed by the clinical isolates were also found in the environment. CTX-M enzymes were the most common enzymes whatever the origin of the isolates.Conclusions. The treatment at the WWTP led to the relative enrichment of ESBLEC. We estimated that >600 billion of ESBLEC are released into the river Doubs daily and the sludge produced by the WWTP, used as fertilizer, contains 2.6 × 105 ESBLEC per gram. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author.},

abstract = {We report on the genomic characterization of 47 multi-drug resistant, carbapenem resistant and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates from the influent (I) and effluent (E) of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and from Romanian hospital units which are discharging the wastewater in the sampled WWTPs. The K. pneumoniae whole genome sequences were analyzed for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence genes and sequence types (STs) in order to compare their distribution in C, I and E samples. Both clinical and environmental samples harbored prevalent and widely distributed ESBL genes, i.e. blaSHV, blaOXA, blaTEM and blaCTX M. The most prevalent carbapenemase genes were blaNDM-1, blaOXA-48 and blaKPC-2. They were found in all types of isolates, while blaOXA-162, a rare blaOXA-48 variant, was found exclusively in water samples. A higher diversity of carbapenemases genes was seen in wastewater isolates. The aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AME) genes found in all types of samples were aac(6'), ant(2'')Ia, aph(3'), aaD, aac(3) and aph(6). Quinolone resistance gene qnrS1 and the multi-drug resistance oqxA/B pump gene were found in all samples, while qnrD and qnrB were associated to aquatic isolates. The antiseptics resistance gene qacEdelta1 was found in all samples, while qacE was detected exclusively in the clinical ones. Trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole (dfrA, sul1 and sul2), tetracyclines (tetA and tetD) and fosfomycin (fosA6, known to be located on a transpozon) resistance genes were found in all samples, while for choramphenicol and macrolides some ARGs were detected in all samples (catA1 and catB3 / mphA), while other (catA2, cmIA5 and aac(6')Ib / mphE and msrE) only in wastewater samples. The rifampin resistance genes arr2 and 3 (both carried by class I integrons) were detected only in water samples. The highly prevalent ARGs preferentially associating with aquatic versus clinical samples could ascribe potential markers for the aquatic (blaSHV-145, qacEdelta1, sul1, aadA1, aadA2) and clinical (blaOXA-1, blaSHV-106,blaTEM-150, aac(3)Iia, dfrA14, oqxA10; oqxB17,catB3, tetD) reservoirs of AR. Moreover, some ARGs (oqxA10; blaSHV-145; blaSHV-100, aac(6')Il, aph(3') VI, armA, arr2, cmlA5, blaCMY-4, mphE, msrE, oqxB13, blaOXA-10) showing decreased prevalence in influent versus effluent wastewater samples could be used as markers for the efficiency of the WWTPs in eliminating AR bacteria and ARGs. The highest number of virulence genes (75) was recorded for the I samples, while for E and C samples it was reduced to half. The most prevalent belong to three functional groups: adherence (fim genes), iron acquisition (ent, fep, fyu, irp and ybt genes) and the secretion system (omp genes). However, none of the genes associated with hypervirulent K. pneumoniae have been found. A total of 14 STs were identified. The most prevalent clones were ST101, ST219 in clinical samples and ST258, ST395 in aquatic isolates. These STs were also the most frequently associated with integrons. ST45 and ST485 were exclusively associated with I samples, ST11, ST35, ST364 with E and ST1564 with C samples. The less frequent ST17 and ST307 aquatic isolates harbored blaOXA-162, which was co-expressed in our strains with blaCTX-M-15 and blaOXA-1.},

abstract = {The spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is a growing global problem.  Activated sludge (AS) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been proposed as a hotspot for ARGs. However, few studies have been conducted to uncover the temporal dynamics of the resistome of AS in WWTPs by long-term longitudinal sampling. In this study, we quantified ARGs and identified their host microbiome in a Hong Kong WWTP in 97 monthly AS samples spanning 9 years. Throughout this analysis, we demonstrated that both the abundance and structures of the resistome changed significantly every two to three years, implying that there was a successive selection of resistomes in the AS system over the study period. The detection of genes of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are emerging major threats to public health in the AS samples, including mcr, CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) and MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus)-related genes, highlight the role of WWTPs as reservoirs of ARGs. In addition, the core resistome (abundant and persistent genes) in AS were found to overlap with those in other ecosystems such as urban sewage, livestock feces, and fishpond sediments, revealing the broad dissemination of ARGs in WWTPs and other environments. Annual variation of resistomes were explained via structural equation modeling (SEM), which deciphered the structural linkages of determining factors such as the operational parameters, microbial community composition and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Specifically, potentially relevant antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARBs) were explored and discussed based on assembly-based analyses and network correlations. Moreover, consistent with the clear relationship between resistomes and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), it was found that there was a relatively high potential for gene exchange in AS in comparison with soil genomes, which could be explained by the engineering features of WWTPs. Based on these findings, longitudinal monitoring of WWTPs is warranted for risk assessment to reveal emerging ARGs, resistome evolution, correlations with ARBs, and the potential for spread in downstream environments and concomitant exposure risks for humans.},

abstract = {The spreading of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the environment is a threat to  human health but little is known about the transmission of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli from the hospital and municipal sewage to the water basin and to the air at the WWTPs (Waste Water Treatment Plants) area and their surroundings. Accordingly, it seems particularly interesting to trace the fate of these bacteria and their genes encoding antibiotic resistance in both untreated sewage from hospitals, and in sewage after different stages of purification, and finally to examine the degree of their emissions to environment. Although wastewater treatment processes reduce number of bacteria in sewage up to 99%, in the presented study it was reported that more than 2.7x10(3) CFU/mL E. coli reached the receiving water and contributed to dissemination of resistant bacteria into the environment. We received 395 E. coli strains from sewage and environmental samples and we investigated their antibiotic susceptibility and the presence of bla gene encoding TEM, CTX, OXA and SHV. From among 167 and 147 E. coli strains isolated from hospital effluents and municipal sewage in Olsztyn, Poland, up to 37.1% and 17.7%, respectively, were ESBL-positive. From among 38 and 43 strains isolated from river water and the air up to 18.4% and 27.9%, respectively, were ESBL-producers. The blaCTX-M (blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-3, blaCTX-M-5, blaCTX-M-15) genes were the predominant group of the plasmid-coded ESBLs. More than 38% out of ESBL-producing isolates carried several bla genes. The multiple-antibiotic-resistant (MAR) indexes for ESBL-positive were higher than for ESBL-negative isolates and ranged from 0.45 to 0.63. The MAR indexes for E. coli from hospital effluents and air samples were greater than the indexes calculated for strains isolated from other samples. Presumably, the preliminary disinfection of hospital sewage before its inflow into the sewage system might minimize the spreading of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to the environment.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Urban, hospital wastewater and pig faeces exhibited high VREF prevalence of 52%, 87% and 85%, respectively. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) clustering of VREF genotypes as well as discriminant analysis of antibiotic resistance patterns of VREF strains revealed their source specificity while strains isolated from hospitalized humans were genetically distinct. CONCLUSIONS: PFGE genotypes and antimicrobial resistance patterns in VREF isolates are distinguishable by each sample origin. The observed high genetic diversity of VREF suggests horizontal transfer of genetic elements among VREF. Phenotypic and genotypic data indicate that VREF isolates of hospital-treated wastewater might pass to the urban wastewater system. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides information to understand the origin and the mechanism of circulation of vancomycin resistance in food animals and wastewater treatment plants for minimizing the risk of transmission of VRE in human population.},

abstract = {Aim: Antibiotic resistance in wastewaters reflects the clinical resistome. This study aimed at investigating whether changes in the population size and composition in the popular tourist destination of Zakynthos island are associated with differentiation in the antibiotic resistance of environmental micro-organisms isolated from wastewater. Methods and Results: The resistance profiles of four species (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Enterococcus sp.) were studied in 124 raw and treated municipal wastewaters from November 2015 to August 2016. Isolates were tested against their susceptibility to several antibiotics of different antimicrobial categories. Data concerning the alteration in the population size and composition, due to the tourist mobility, were collected and logistic regression models were used to examine the relationships between antimicrobial resistance and population changes. The decrease in resistance of E. coli to amoxicillin–clavulanate, of enterococci to norfloxacin and ampicillin, and of pseudomonads to almost all antibiotics tested was associated with population increase due to tourist flows. In contrast, the presence of tourists was linked to an increase in quinupristin-dalfopristin resistant enterococci. Resistance of staphylococci did not change during the tourist period. Conclusion: Changes in population composition in touristic areas are reflected in antibiotic resistance of environmental bacteria in wastewater. Significance and Impact of the Study: In touristic areas, where people carrying different resistomes are merged, medication should be adapted accordingly.},

abstract = {Integrated antibiotic resistance (AR) surveillance is one of the objectives of the World Health Organization global action plan on antimicrobial resistance. Urban wastewater treatment plants (UWTPs) are among the most important receptors and sources of environmental AR. On the basis of the consistent observation of an increasing north-to-south clinical AR prevalence in Europe, this study compared the influent and final effluent of 12 UWTPs located in seven countries (Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Cyprus, Germany, Finland, and Norway). Using highly parallel quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we analyzed 229 resistance genes and 25 mobile genetic elements. This first trans-Europe surveillance showed that UWTP AR profiles mirror the AR gradient observed in clinics. Antibiotic use, environmental temperature, and UWTP size were important factors related with resistance persistence and spread in the environment. These results highlight the need to implement regular surveillance and control measures, which may need to be appropriate for the geographic regions.},

abstract = {Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) is a leading cause of  healthcare-associated infection. Reservoirs of VREfm are largely assumed to be nosocomial although there is a paucity of data on alternative sources. Here, we describe an integrated epidemiological and genomic analysis of E. faecium associated with bloodstream infection and isolated from wastewater. Treated and untreated wastewater from 20 municipal treatment plants in the East of England, United Kingdom was obtained and cultured to isolate E. faecium, ampicillin-resistant E. faecium (AREfm), and VREfm. VREfm was isolated from all 20 treatment plants and was released into the environment by 17/20 plants, the exceptions using terminal ultraviolet light disinfection. Median log(10) counts of AREfm and VREfm in untreated wastewater from 10 plants in direct receipt of hospital sewage were significantly higher than 10 plants that were not. We sequenced and compared the genomes of 423 isolates from wastewater with 187 isolates associated with bloodstream infection at five hospitals in the East of England. Among 481 E. faecium isolates belonging to the hospital-adapted clade, we observed genetic intermixing between wastewater and bloodstream infection, with highly related isolates shared between a major teaching hospital in the East of England and 9/20 plants. We detected 28 antibiotic resistance genes in the hospital-adapted clade, of which 23 were represented in bloodstream, hospital sewage, and municipal wastewater isolates. We conclude that our findings are consistent with widespread distribution of hospital-adapted VREfm beyond acute healthcare settings with extensive release of VREfm into the environment in the East of England.},

abstract = {There is a risk that residues of antibiotics and other antimicrobials in hospital and municipal wastewaters could select for resistant bacteria. Still, direct experimental evidence for selection is lacking. Here, we investigated if effluent from a large Swedish hospital, as well as influent and effluent from the connected municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) select for antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli in three controlled experimental setups. Exposure of sterile-filtered hospital effluent to a planktonic mix of 149 different E. coli wastewater isolates showed a strong selection of multi-resistant strains. Accordingly, exposure to a complex wastewater community selected for strains resistant to several antibiotic classes. Exposing individual strains with variable resistance patterns revealed a rapid bactericidal effect of hospital effluent on susceptible, but not multi-resistant E. coli. No selection was observed after exposure to WWTP effluent, while exposure to WWTP influent indicated a small selective effect for ceftazidime and cefadroxil resistant strains, and only in the E. coli mix assay. An analysis of commonly used antibiotics and non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals in combination with growth and resistance pattern of individual E. coli isolates suggested a possible contribution of ciprofloxacin and $\beta$-lactams to the selection by hospital effluent. However, more research is needed to clarify the contribution from different selective agents. While this study does not indicate selection by the studied WWTP effluent, there is some indications of selective effects by municipal influent on $\beta$-lactam-resistant strains. Such effects may be more pronounced in countries with higher antibiotic use than Sweden. Despite the limited antibiotic use in Sweden, the hospital effluent strongly and consistently selected for multi-resistance, indicating widespread risks. Hence, there is an urgent need for further evaluation of risks for resistance selection in hospital sewers, as well as for strategies to remove selective agents and resistant bacteria.},

abstract = {Comprehensive surveillance approaches are needed to assess sources, clinical  relevance, and mobility of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in watersheds. Here, we examined metrics derived from shotgun metagenomic sequencing and relationship to human fecal markers (HFMs; crAssphage, enterococci) and anthropogenic antibiotic resistance markers (AARMs; intI1, sul1) in three distinct Puerto Rican watersheds as a function of adjacent land use and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) input 6 months after Hurricane Maria, a category V storm. Relative abundance and diversity of total ARGs increased markedly downstream of WWTP inputs, with ARGs unique to WWTP and WWTP-impacted river samples predominantly belonging to the aminoglycoside and $\beta$-lactam resistance classes. WWTP and other anthropogenic inputs were similarly associated with elevated resistome risk scores and mobility incidence (M%). Contig analysis indicated a wide variety of mobile $\beta$-lactam ARGs associated with pathogens downstream of WWTP discharge that were consistent with regional clinical concern, e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae contigs containing KPC-2 within an ISKpn6-like transposase. HFMs and AARMs correlated strongly with the absolute abundance of total ARGs, but AARMs better predicted the majority of ARGs in general (85.4 versus <2%) and $\beta$-lactam ARGs in particular. This study reveals sensitive, quantitative, mobile, clinically relevant, and comprehensive targets for antibiotic resistance surveillance in watersheds.},

So far, 1578 samples have been collected from different countries within the EU (Sweden, Denmark, UK and Spain), and from different habitats (pig farms, carcasses in slaughter houses, soil, manure, water, sewage, and humans). Total and vancomycin resistant enterococcal populations in each sample have been enumerated and more than 12 000 isolates have been characterised by phenotyping. Representative isolates are further species identified and characterised by genotyping and MIC determination and from antibiotic resistant isolates the resistance genes are characterised.

abstract = {In this study, antibiotic resistance class 3 integrons in Gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospital sewage and sludge and their genetic contents were characterised. Two samples of hospital effluent from France and Luxembourg and one sample of sludge from a wastewater treatment plant in France were collected in 2010 and 2011. Bacteria were cultured on selective agar plates and integrons were detected in colonies by quantitative PCR. Integron gene cassette arrays and their genetic environments were analysed by next-generation sequencing. Three class 3 integron-positive isolates were detected, including Acinetobacter johnsonii LIM75 (French hospital effluent), Aeromonas allosaccharophila LIM82 (sludge) and Citrobacter freundii LIM86 (Luxembourg hospital effluent). The gene cassettes were all implicated in antibiotic (aminoglycoside and beta-lactam) or antiseptic resistance. An oxacillinase gene cassette (blaOXA-10, blaOXA-368 or blaOXA-2) was found in each integron. All of the class 3 integrons were located on small mobilisable plasmids. This study highlights the role of class 3 integrons in the dissemination of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes, notably oxacillinase genes, in hospital effluent.},

In this study, American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) from sewage treatment plants (WWTP), dairy farms, and a large roost in a restored wetland with corresponding environmental samples were cultured for VRE. A total of 245 samples [156 crows, 89 environmental] were collected and screened for acquired vanA, vanB and/or intrinsic vanC1 genes. Samples were enriched overnight in BHI supplemented with 20mug/mL aztreonam, 4mug/mL vancomycin and plated on m-Enterococcus agar media supplemented with 6mug/mL vancomycin. Selected colonies were grown on BHI media supplemented with 18mug/mL vancomycin. Of these, 24.5% of the crow and 55% the environmental/cow samples were VRE positive as defined by Enterococcus spp. able to grow on media supplemented with 18mug/mL vancomycin. A total of 122 VRE isolates, 43 crow and 79 environmental isolates were screened, identified to species level using 16S sequencing and further characterized. Four vanA E. faecium and multiple vanC1 E. gallinarum were identified from crows isolated from three sites. E. faecium vanA and E. gallinarum vanC1 along with other Enterococcus spp. carrying vanA, vanB, vanC1 were isolated from three environments. All enterococci were multidrug resistant. Crows were more likely to carry vanA E. faecium than either the cow feces or wetland waters/soils. Comparing E. gallinarum vanC1 from crows and their environment would be useful in determining whether crows share VRE strains with their environment.},

abstract = {In this study, the in vitro susceptibility of 209 campylobacter strains to the quinolones nalidixic acid, flumequine, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and to ampicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin was tested by the disk diffusion method. The strains were isolated from poultry abattoir effluent (DWA) and two sewage purification plants (SPA and SPB). Sewage purification plant SPA received mixed sewage, including that from a poultry abattoir, whereas SPB did not receive sewage from any meat-processing industry. The quinolone resistance of the DWA isolates ranged from 28% for enrofloxacin to 50% for nalidixic acid. The strains isolated from the sewage purification plants were more susceptible to the quinolones with a range of 11-18% quinolone resistance for SPB isolates to 17-33% quinolone resistance for SPA isolates. The susceptibility criteria as recommended by National Committee Clinical Laboratory Standards (USA) cannot readily be employed for campylobacter isolates. This investigation shows that the resistance of campylobacter bacteria is highest in the plant receiving sewage from a poultry slaughterhouse. Monitoring of antibiotic resistance of aquatic Campylobacter spp. is important, as surface waters are recognized as possible sources of infection.},

abstract = {Presence of multiple drug resistant pathogens in hospital waste is a serious public  health concern, because it may ultimately be disseminated to the human. Current study was designed with the objective to estimate the occurrence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in hospital settings and waste. For this purpose, cross sectional study for a period of one year was designed and non-probability sampling techniques was used to collect total n=112 samples from various sample sources of hospital waste including ward waste, operation theatre waste, wastewater and hospital sludge. Isolation of the K. pneumoniae was done by using selective agar, biochemical identification of the isolates was done through API 20E kit (bioM{\'{e}}rieux, France). Molecular identification of the isolates was done by amplifying 16SrDNA with PCR. According to CLSI guidelines disc diffusion assay was performed for antibiotic susceptibility profiling. PCR of MDR isolates was done for the molecular detection of various ESBL genes. Results of the study showed 17 (15%) percentage prevalence of MDR K. pneumoniae from all 112 collected samples. Among various sample sources wastewater showed the highest percentage (23%) prevalence of MDR K. pneumoniae. In 17 confirmed isolates bla(CTX-M) and blaCTX-M1 were found in 13 (76%) and 12 (71%) respectively which showed the highest prevalence as compared to all other investigated genes. While bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(NDM-1) and bla(OXA-48) were found with percentage prevalence 9 (53 %), 1 (6%), 9 (53%) and 6 (35 %) respectively. Whereas bla(KPC), bla(IMP), bla(VIM) and bla(GIM) were not detected in any of the isolate. Taking together, strict rules and regulations should be adopted at public as well as hospital level to restrict the dissemination of antibiotic resistance from hospital environment to humans.},

abstract = {The global widespread use of antimicrobials and accompanying increase in resistant bacterial strains is of major public health concern. Wastewater systems and wastewater treatment plants are considered a niche for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), with diverse microbial communities facilitating ARG transfer via mobile genetic element (MGE). In contrast to hospital sewage, wastewater from other health care facilities is still poorly investigated. At the instance of a nursing home located in south-west Germany, in the present study, shotgun metagenomics was used to investigate the impact on wastewater of samples collected up- and down-stream in different seasons. Microbial composition, ARGs and MGEs were analyzed using different annotation approaches with various databases, including Antibiotic Resistance Ontologies (ARO), integrons and plasmids. Our analysis identified seasonal differences in microbial communities and abundance of ARG and MGE between samples from different seasons. However, no obvious differences were detected between up- and downstream samples. The results suggest that, in contrast to hospitals, sewage from the nursing home does not have a major impact on ARG or MGE in wastewater, presumably due to much less intense antimicrobial usage. Possible limitations of metagenomic studies using high-throughput sequencing for detection of genes that seemingly confer antibiotic resistance are discussed.},

abstract = {Urban waterways represent a natural reservoir of antibiotic resistance which may provide a source of transferable genetic elements to human commensal bacteria and pathogens. The objective of this study was to evaluate antibiotic resistance of Escherichia coli isolated from the urban waterways of Milwaukee, WI compared to those from Milwaukee sewage and a clinical setting in Milwaukee. Antibiotics covering 10 different families were utilized to determine the phenotypic antibiotic resistance for all 259 E. coli isolates. All obtained isolates were determined to be multi-drug resistant. The E. coli isolates were also screened for the presence of the genetic determinants of resistance including ermB (macrolide resistance), tet(M) (tetracycline resistance), and $\beta$-lactamases (blaOXA, blaSHV, and blaPSE). E. coli from urban waterways showed a greater incidence of antibiotic resistance to 8 of 17 antibiotics tested compared to human derived sources. These E. coli isolates also demonstrated a greater incidence of resistance to higher numbers of antibiotics compared to the human derived isolates. The urban waterways demonstrated a greater abundance of isolates with co-occurrence of antibiotic resistance than human derived sources. When screened for five different antibiotic resistance genes conferring macrolide, tetracycline, and {\ss}-lactam resistance, clinical E. coli isolates were more likely to harbor ermB and blaOXA than isolates from urban waterway. These results indicate that Milwaukee's urban waterways may select or allow for a greater incidence of multiple antibiotic resistance organisms and likely harbor a different antibiotic resistance gene pool than clinical sources. The implications of this study are significant to understanding the presence of resistance in urban freshwater environments by supporting the idea that sediment from urban waterways serves as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {We investigated the antimicrobial resistance profile and the occurrence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Gram-negative rods in sewage samples obtained from a Brazilian teaching hospital and from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that receives it for treatment. We identified multidrug-resistant bacteria as well as KPC-2-producing Aeromonas spp. and several Enterobacteriaceae species, including Kluyvera spp., in the hospital effluent and in different sites of the WWTP. Most isolates showed the blaKPC-2 gene harbored on a transposon that was carried by conjugative plasmids. The presence of KPC production among Aeromonas spp., Kluyvera spp., and other Enterobacteriaceae indicates the adaptability of such isolates to aquatic environments, not only in the hospital effluent but also throughout the WWTP. Although secondary treatment seems to decrease the amount of KPC producers in sewage, multidrug-resistant isolates are continually disposed in the urban river. Thus, sewage treatment regulations are urgently needed to decelerate the evolution of antimicrobial resistance beyond hospitals. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We examined whether genomic surveillance of Escherichia coli in wastewater could capture the dominant E. coli lineages associated with bloodstream infection and livestock in the East of England, together with the antibiotic-resistance genes circulating in the wider E. coli population. Treated and untreated wastewater was taken from 20 municipal treatment plants in the East of England, half in direct receipt of acute hospital waste. All samples were culture positive for E. coli, and all but one were positive for extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli. The most stringent wastewater treatment (tertiary including UV light) did not eradicate ESBL-E. coli in 2/3 cases. We sequenced 388 E. coli (192 ESBL, 196 non-ESBL). Multilocus sequence type (ST) diversity was similar between plants in direct receipt of hospital waste versus the remainder (93 vs 95 STs, respectively). We compared the genomes of wastewater E. coli with isolates from bloodstream infection (n=437), and livestock farms and retail meat (n=431) in the East of England. A total of 19/20 wastewater plants contained one or more of the three most common STs associated with bloodstream infection (ST131, ST73, ST95), and 14/20 contained the most common livestock ST (ST10). In an analysis of 1254 genomes (2 cryptic E. coli were excluded), wastewater isolates were distributed across the phylogeny and intermixed with isolates from humans and livestock. Ten blaCTX-M elements were identified in E. coli isolated from wastewater, together with a further 47 genes encoding resistance to the major antibiotic drug groups. Genes encoding resistance to colistin and the carbapenems were not detected. Genomic surveillance of E. coli in wastewater could be used to monitor new and circulating lineages and resistance determinants of public-health importance.},

abstract = {The emergence of clinical enterococcal isolates that are resistant to both ampicillin and vancomycin is a cause of great concern, as therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of infections caused by such organisms are becoming limited. Aquatic environments could play a role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistant enterococci. This study investigated the presence of ampicillin and vancomycin resistant enterococci in the treated effluent of six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and in surface water used as a source for drinking water production in the Netherlands. Membrane filtration in combination with selective media with ampicillin or vancomycin was applied to determine the presence of ampicillin resistant Enterococcus (ARE) and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE) species. Ampicillin resistant Enterococcus faecium (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) >16 $\mu$g/mL; n = 1033) was observed in all studied WWTP effluents. In surface water used for drinking water production (intake locations), no ARE or VRE were observed. At both types of location, intrinsic vancomycin resistant Pediococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp. and Lactobacillus spp. were isolated with the vancomycin medium. The ampicillin resistant E. faecium (AREfm) isolates (n = 113) did not contain the vanA or vanB gene, but MIC testing for vancomycin showed intermediate vancomycin resistance (2-8 $\mu$g mL-1) to occur in these AREfm strains. This study documents the discharge of ampicillin resistant E. faecium strains with intermediate vancomycin resistance by the WWTPs into the surface water, but no presence of these strains downstream at intake locations for drinking water production.},

abstract = {Selection and dissemination of resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes  (ARGs) require a deeper understanding since antibiotics are permanently released to the environment. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the phenotypic resistance of 499 isolates of Pseudomonas spp. from urban water sources, and the prevalence of 20 ARGs within those isolates. Resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, quinolones, macrolides, and tetracyclines was mainly observed in the hospital effluent, municipal wastewater and river water downstream the city. Resistant strains were frequently identified as P. aeruginosa and P. putida. P. aeruginosa isolates were mostly resistant to cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamycin, while P. putida strains were especially resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam. ARGs such as bla(TEM-1), bla(SHV-1), bla(PER-1), bla(AmpC), bla(VIM-1), PstS, qnrA, qnrB, ermB, tetA, tetB and tetC have been detected. The bla(AmpC) gene was found in P. aeruginosa, while bla(TEM-1) and bla(PER-1) genes were found in P. putida. Class 1 integron integrase gene was found in 6.81% of the Pseudomonas isolates.},

abstract = {The increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria has raised global concern regarding the future effectiveness of antibiotics. Human activities that influence microbial communities and environmental resistomes can generate additional risks to human health. In this work, we characterized aquatic microbial communities and their resistomes in samples collected at three sites along the Bogot{\'{a}} River and from wastewaters at three city hospitals, and investigated community profiles and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) as a function of anthropogenic contamination. The presence of antibiotics and other commonly used drugs increased in locations highly impacted by human activities, while the diverse microbial communities varied among sites and sampling times, separating upstream river samples from more contaminated hospital and river samples. Clinically relevant antibiotic resistant pathogens and ARGs were more abundant in contaminated water samples. Tracking of resistant determinants to upstream river waters and city sources suggested that human activities foster the spread of ARGs, some of which were co-localized with mobile genetic elements in assembled metagenomic contigs. Human contamination of this water ecosystem changed both community structure and environmental resistomes that can pose a risk to human health.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is not restricted to clinics but also spreading fast in the aquatic environment. This study focused on the prevalence and diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes among bacteria from lentic and effluent water in Delhi-NCR, India. Phenotypic screening of 436 morphologically distinct bacterial isolates collected from diverse sites revealed that 106 (similar to 24%) isolates were ESBL positive. Antibiotic profiling showed that 42, 60, 78 and 59% ESBL producing isolates collected from Ghazipur slaughterhouse, Lodhi garden pond, Hauz Khas lake and Jasola wastewater treatment plant, respectively, were multidrug-resistant (MDR). The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index varied from 0.20 to 0.32 among selected locations. The prevalence of ESBL gene variants blaSHV, blaTEM and blaCTX-M were found to be 17.64, 35.29 and 64%, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis of obtained gene sequences showed three variants of blaCTX-M (15, 152 and 205) and two variants of blaTEM (TEM-1 and TEM-116) among ESBLs producers. The co-existence of 2-3 gene variants was recorded among 48% ESBL positive isolates. New reports from this study include the blaCTX-M gene in Acinetobacter lwoffii, Enterobacter ludwigii, Exiguobacterium mexicanum and Aeromonas caviae. Furthermore, the identification of blaTEM and blaSHV in an environmental isolate of A. caviae is a new report from India.},

We investigated the potential sources and reservoir of SA resistance (SR) in Larut River and Sangga Besar River by measuring the SA residues, sulfamethoxazole resistant (SMX(r)) in bacteria and their resistance genes (SRGs). The SA residues measured ranged from lower than quantification limits (LOQ) to 33.13 ng L(-1) with sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfadimethoxine (SDM) and SMX as most detected. Hospital wastewater effluent was detected with the highest SA residues concentration followed by the slaughterhouse and zoo wastewater effluents. The wastewater effluents also harbored the highest abundance of SMX(r)-bacteria (10(7) CFU mL(-1)) and SRGs (10(-1)/16S copies mL(-1)). Pearson correlation showed only positive correlation between the PO(4) and SMX(r)-bacteria. In conclusion, wastewater effluents from the zoo, hospital and slaughterhouse could serve as important sources of SA residues that could lead to the consequent emergence of SMX(r)-bacteria and SRGs in the river.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global concern, especially in India where the burden of infectious diseases is high and health care spending is low. Here we quantified total coliform, faecal coliforms (FC), carbapenem-resistant enteric bacteria (CRE), blaNDM-1, and three integron genes in samples collected from wastewater effluent of 12 hospitals, 12 sewage treatment plants (STPs), 20 sewer drains, and five locations along the Yamuna River in New Delhi over two seasons. Significant correlations were found between FC levels, CRE (r = 0.903, p = 0.004, n = 49) and blaNDM-1 (r = 0.787, p = 0.003, n = 49) concentrations across all samples. Concentrations of coliforms, CRE, blaNDM-1, int1, and int3 were highest in hospital effluents compared to other locations in both seasons. Although absolute concentration data indicate greater abundances of CRE and blaNDM-1 in the winter, normalised data indicates greater carriage of blaNDM-1 per cell in summer samples. In general, observed CRE levels were highest in surface water downstream of areas with higher population densities. Among CRE isolates (n = 4077), 82%, 75%, 71% and 43% of the strains from hospitals, sewer drains, river samples, and STPs, respectively, contained blaNDM-1, implying STPs have relatively fewer blaNDM-1 positive CRE in their effluents. The most common CRE isolates in the drains were Pseudomonas putida (39%) followed by Acinetobacter baumanni (20%) and Pseudomonas montelli (19%). The present scenario in New Delhi highlights the urgent need for increased coverage of appropriate waste treatment facilities across the city to reduce CRE exposures from polluted surface waters.},

abstract = {Carbapenemase-producing bacteria (CPB) are rare, multidrug resistant organisms most commonly associated with hospitalized patients. Metropolitan wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) treat wastewater from large geographic areas which include hospitals and may serve as epidemiologic reservoirs for the maintenance or expansion of CPB that originate from hospitals and are ultimately discharged in treated effluent. However, little is known about the potential impact of these WWTP CPB on the local surface water and their risk to the public health. In addition, CPB that are present in surface water may ultimately disseminate to intensively-managed animal agriculture facilities where there is potential for amplification by extended-spectrum cephalosporins. To better understand the role of WWTPs in the dissemination of CPB in surface waters, we obtained samples of treated effluent, and both upstream and downstream nearby surface water from 50 WWTPs throughout the US. A total of 30 CPB with clinically-relevant genotypes were recovered from 15 WWTPs (30%) of which 13 (50%) serviced large metropolitan areas and 2 (8.3%) represented small rural populations (P < 0.05). Recovery of CPB was lowest among WWTPs that utilized ultraviolet radiation for primary disinfection (12%), and higher (P = 0.11) for WWTPs that used chlorination (42%) or that did not utilize disinfection (50%). We did not detect a difference in CPB recovery by sampling site, although fewer CPB were detected in upstream (8%) compared to effluent (20%) and downstream (18%) samples. Our results indicate that WWTP effluent and nearby surface waters in the US are routinely contaminated with CPB with clinically important genotypes including those producing Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM). This is a concern for both public health and animal agriculture because introduction of CPB into intensively managed livestock populations could lead to their amplification and foodborne dissemination.},

abstract = {Microbial populations which are resistant to antibiotics are an emerging environmental concern with potentially serious implications for public health. Thus, there is a growing concern in exploring the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in the environment with no limitations to the factors that contribute to their emergence. The aquatic environment is considered to be a hot-spot for the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance due to pollution with emerging contaminants derived from anthropogenic activities. In this study, we report on the isolation and characterization of 141 Pseudomonas spp. from aquatic sediments receiving partially (un)treated hospital and communal effluents from three distinct geographical locations: Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), India (IN), and Switzerland (CH). P. putida (42%) and P. aeruginosa (39%) were the dominant Pseudomonas species. The highest frequency of antibiotic resistance against eight anti-pseudomonas agents was found among IN isolates (35-60%), followed by DRC (18-50%) and CH (12-54%). CTX-M was the most frequent beta-lactamase found in CH (47% of isolates), while VIM-1 was dominant in isolates from DRC (61%) and IN (29%). NDM-1 was found in 29% of the total IN isolates and surprisingly also in 6% of CH isolates. Chromosomally-encoded efflux mechanisms were overexpressed in P. aeruginosa isolates from all three geographic locations. In vitro conjugative transfers of antibiotic resistance plasmids occurred more frequently under tropical temperatures (30 and 37 degrees C) than under temperate conditions (10 degrees C). The presence of Extended Spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and Metallo beta-lactamases (MBLs) in the isolates from environmental samples has important implications for humans who depend on public water supply and sanitation facilities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a comparison between treated/untreated effluents from urban and hospital settings as a source of microbial resistance by evaluating the aquatic ecosystems sediments from tropical and temperate climate conditions. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a widespread occurrence of antibiotic resistance in aquatic ecosystems sediments receiving untreated/treated wastewater and how these contemporary sources of contamination, contribute to the spread of microbial resistance in the aquatic environment. This research presents also useful tools to evaluate sediment quality in the receiving river/reservoir systems which can be applied to similar environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Propose: Among antibiotic resistance cases, resistance to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics is a major concern for the treatment of microbial infections. Furthermore, the prevalence of extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBL) Escherichia coli (E. coli) in environment, food, and human resources of Iran has increased over the past few years. This study aimed to predict the relationship between the prevalence of ESBL E. coli in the environment and the food chains with the presence of this infection in people suspected of septicemia using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis model. Methods: In this analytical cross sectional study samples were collected from the environment (hospital sewage, downstream and upstream urban sewage, and slaughterhouse sewage), food (chicken), and human chains (people suspected of septicemia) in Tehran province, Iran. This study was conducted from September to February 2019 and the prevalence of ESBL E. coli was calculated in each resource. Then, the relationship between the prevalence of ESBL E. coli in the environment and food chains and its prevalence in the human chain was predicted using the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. Results: The results showed the prevalence of ESBL E. coli in those suspected of septicemia in September, October, November, December, January and February was 58.1%, 60%, 33.3%, 100%, 43%, and 57.8%, respectively. Also, the results of the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis indicated hospital wastewater and chicken contamination with ESBL E. coli were the main causes of contamination with ESBL E. coli in people suspected of septicemia. Conclusions: According to the results of this study, if there is a contamination of hospital wastewater and chickens in an area, it can be claimed that people suspected of septicemia are infected with ESBL E. coli, and the percentage of this contamination can be high. On the other hand, controlling ESBL E. coli in hospital wastewater (environmental chain) and chickens (food chain) can prevent contamination in people with suspected septicemia.},

abstract = {Objectives: Oxazolidinone resistance is a serious limitation in the treatment of  MDR Enterococcus infections. Plasmid-mediated oxazolidinone resistance has been strongly linked to animals where the use of phenicols might co-select resistance to both antibiotic families. Our goal was to assess the diversity of genes conferring phenicol/oxazolidinone resistance among diverse enterococci and to characterize the optrA genetic environment. Methods: Chloramphenicol-resistant isolates (>16 mg/L, n = 245) from different sources (hospitals/healthy humans/wastewaters/animals) in Portugal, Angola and Tunisia (1996-2016) were selected. Phenicol (eight cat variants, fexA, fexB) or phenicol + oxazolidinone [cfr, cfr(B), optrA] resistance genes were searched for by PCR. Susceptibility (disc diffusion/microdilution), filter mating, stability of antibiotic resistance (500 bacterial generations), plasmid typing (S1-PFGE/hybridization), MLST and WGS (Illumina-HiSeq) were performed for optrA-positive isolates. Results: Resistance to phenicols (n = 181, 74%) and phenicols + oxazolidinones (n = 2, 1%) was associated with the presence of cat(A-8) (40%, predominant in hospitals and swine), cat(A-7) (29%, predominant in poultry and healthy humans), cat(A-9) (2%), fexB (2%) and fexA + optrA (1%). fexA and optrA genes were co-located in a transferable plasmid (pAF379, 72918 bp) of two ST86 MDR Tunisian Enterococcus faecalis (wastewaters) carrying several putative virulence genes. MICs of chloramphenicol, linezolid and tedizolid were stably maintained at 64, 4 and 1 mg/L, respectively. The chimeric pAF379 comprised relics of genetic elements from different Gram-positive bacteria and origins (human/porcine). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, we report the first detection of optrA in an African country (Tunisia) within a transferable mosaic plasmid of different origins. Its identification in isolates from environmental sources is worrisome and alerts for the need of a concerted global surveillance on the occurrence and spread of optrA.},

abstract = {Counts of Escherichia coli cells in water indicate the potential presence of pathogenic microbes of intestinal origin but give no indication of the sources of the microbial pollution. The objective of this research was to evaluate methods for differentiating E. coli isolates of livestock, wildlife, or human origin that might be used to predict the sources of fecal pollution of water. A collection of 319 E. coli isolates from the feces of cattle, poultry, swine, deer, goose, and moose, as well as from human sewage, and clinical samples was used to evaluate three methods. One method was the multiple-antibiotic-resistance (MAR) profile using 14 antibiotics. Discriminant analysis revealed that 46% of the livestock isolates, 95% of the wildlife isolates, and 55% of the human isolates were assigned to the correct source groups by the MAR method. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, the second test, was applied to 105 of the E. coli isolates. The AFLP results showed that 94% of the livestock isolates, 97% of the wildlife isolates, and 97% of the human isolates were correctly classified. The third method was analysis of the sequences of thel6S rRNA genes of the E. coli isolates. Discriminant analysis of 105 E. coli isolates indicated that 78% of the livestock isolates, 74% of the wildlife isolates, and 80% of the human isolates could be correctly classified into their host groups by this method. The results indicate that AFLP analysis was the most effective of the three methods that were evaluated.},

These strains were also resistant to up to 9 non-$\beta$-lactam antibiotics and showed the same pattern of resistance in all samples. More than 73% of the hospital wastewater isolates possessed SHV-type ESBL as opposed to isolates from STPs that carried only CTX-M-type ESBL genes. The prevalence of the intI gene did not differ between the sources of the isolates. Certain ESBL-producing E. coli were dominant in hospital wastewaters. These strains possessed $\beta$-lactamase genes that were different from isolates found in STPs.

abstract = {In this study, the species diversity of staphylococci with inducible resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (MLSB) isolated from clinical samples, sewage and river water was investigated. Inducible clindamycin resistance was tested using a D-test and macrodilution assays. Inducible cross-resistance (iMLSB phenotype) was examined by PCR of erm gene classes A, B, C, F, G, Q, T and 43. Although ermC was the most frequently detected resistance gene in iMLSB phenotypes of environmental staphylococci (61.2 %), resistance genes encoding iMLSB were more diverse than in staphylococci from hospital samples. In 22.4% of iMLSB staphylococci from aquatic environments, none of the eight tested erm genes was found. Those isolates and erm43-expressing Staphylococcus lentus displayed low erythromycin MICs (3– 16 $\mu$g ml-1) compared with ermC-positive environmental staphylococci (≥256 $\mu$g ml-1). In contrast to clinical isolates with clearly defined resistance behaviour, resistance patterns against MLSB and MICs for clindamycin of environmental isolates were more diverse. Although the abundance of iMLSB staphylococci in the aquatic environment was lower than in staphylococci from hospital samples, the diversity of resistance genes encoding this phenotype seemed to be higher. Oleandomycin is the best marker to correlate iMLSB phenotype and the respective erm gene. The phenotypical behaviour of environmental isolates may differ from the resistance pattern of clinical iMLSB staphylococci expressing ermA or ermC, and this should be considered for successful treatment of infections.},

abstract = {The authors analyzed resistance to antibiotics of bacterial strains from the family of enterobacteriaceae comparing the resistance of two sets of strains, one set being strains isolated from clinical material of patients, the other being those isolated from municipal waste water of the 4th district of Bratislava. Referring to higher index of resistance in strains isolated from outer environment, they draw attention to high number of strains resistant to ampicillin and tetracyclin in clinical material and that of gentamicin-resistant ones from outer environment. Some views on standardization of empirical antibiotic therapy of infections due to strains from clinical material and outer environment are formulated and changes in the antibiotic spectrum effectivity as compared with past results as well as possible unsatisfactory success in treatment by means of currently applied broad spectrum antibiotics in cases of empiric therapy of infections are pointed to. Information on incidence of polyresistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae in outer environment and municipal waste water is presented.},

abstract = {Vancomycin-resistant enterococcci (VRE) in Europe are thought to have emerged partly due to the use of the glycopeptide avoparcin in animal husbandry. We compared the occurrence of VRE in geographical regions of Europe in which until 1997 large amounts of avoparcin were used (Spain, United Kingdom, and Denmark) with the occurrence of VRE in Sweden, where avoparcin was banned in 1986. We also studied the relatedness between VRE strains from different regions and habitats. In total, 2,580 samples were collected from humans, animals, and the environment (soil, sewage, recipient water). VRE resistant to 20 $\mu$g/ml vancomycin were identified in 8.2% of the samples and were found most frequently in raw and treated urban sewage samples (means, 71% and 36% of the samples, respectively), pig manure (17%), and hospital sewage (16%). The proportions of VRE-positive sewage samples were similar in Sweden, Spain, and the United Kingdom, whereas pig feces and manure were more often positive in Spain than in Sweden (30% versus 1%). Most VRE were Enterococcus faecium carrying vanA, and computerized biochemical phenotyping of the isolates of different ecological origins showed a high degree of polyclonality. In conclusion, it seems that animal-associated VRE probably reflect the former use of avoparcin in animal production, whereas VRE in human-associated samples may be a result of antibiotic use in hospitals. Since there seems to be a reservoir of the resistance genes in all countries studied, precautions must be taken to limit the use of antibiotics and antibiotic-like feed additives.

abstract = {The trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK has been recently described in Staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. A total of 166 enterococci of different species (E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. hirae, E. durans, E. gallinarum, and E. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrK gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. The dfrK gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of ≥2mg/L or ≤1mg/L, respectively). The tet(L)-dfrK linkage was detected in 21% of dfrK-positive enterococci. The chromosomal location of the dfrK gene was identified in one E. faecium isolate in which the dfrK was not linked to tet(L) gene but was part of a Tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radC gene. This Tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. All combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrK, dfrG, dfrF, dfrK+dfrG, dfrK+dfrF, dfrF+dfrG, and dfrF+dfrG+dfrK). The gene dfrK gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. This study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrG. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.},

abstract = {Background: Multi-drug resistant forms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRPA) are a major source of nosocomial infections and when discharged into streams and rivers from hospital wastewater treatment plants (HWWTP) they are known to be able to persist for extended periods. In the city of Manaus (Western Brazilian Amazon), the effluent of three HWWTPs feed into the urban Mindu stream which crosses the city from its rainforest source before draining into the Rio Negro. The stream is routinely used by Manaus residents for bathing and cleaning (of clothes as well as domestic utensils) and, during periods of flooding, can contaminate wells used for drinking water. Results: 16S rRNA metagenomic sequence analysis of 293 cloned PCR fragments, detected an abundance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) at the stream's Rio Negro drainage site, but failed to detect it at the stream's source. An array of antimicrobial resistance profiles and resistance to all 14 tested antimicrobials was detected among P. aeruginosa cultures prepared from wastewater samples taken from water entering and being discharged from a Manaus HWWTP. Just one P. aeruginosa antimicrobial resistance profile, however, was detected from cultures made from Mindu stream isolates. Comparisons made between P. aeruginosa isolates' genomic DNA restriction enzyme digest fingerprints, failed to determine if any of the P. aeruginosa found in the Mindu stream were of HWWTP origin, but suggested that Mindu stream P. aeruginosa are from diverse origins. Culturing experiments also showed that P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and the extent of biofilm formation produced were both significantly higher in multi drug resistant forms of P. aeruginosa. Conclusions: Our results show that a diverse range of MDRPA are being discharged in an urban stream from a HWWTP in Manaus and that P. aeruginosa strains with ampicillin and amikacin can persist well within it.},

abstract = {The aims were to investigate the level of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospital and urban wastewater and to determine the similarity of isolates obtained from wastewater and hospitalized patients. Wastewater samples were collected in September 2013 and 2014. After identification using MALDI-TOF MS, beta-lactamase production was determined by relevant phenotypic tests. Genes responsible for the production of single beta-lactamase groups and Qnr proteins were established. The epidemiological relationship of the isolates from wastewater and hospitalized patients was determined by PFGE. A total of 51 isolates of enterobacteria were obtained. Overall, 45.1% of them produced broad-spectrum beta-lactamases. Genes encoding TEM, SHV, CTX-M, CIT, DHA and EBC types of enzymes and Qnr proteins were detected. No broad-spectrum beta-lactamase production was confirmed in the urban wastewater treatment plant. The most important finding was the detection of two identical isolates of K. pneumoniae in 2013, one from a patient's urinary catheter and the other from a wastewater sample. {\textcopyright} 2016 by Edimes - Edizioni Internazionali Srl.

abstract = {To gain insight into whether Escherichia coli isolated from humans and resistant  to some common antimicrobial agents are derived from animals, 85 E. coli strains were selected by ERIC-PCR from human and animal wastewater samples. Phylogroup, pathogenicity islands (PAIs), resistance to quinolones, fluoroquinolones and presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were analyzed. Among the total, 55% were resistant to nalidixic acid and 38% to ciprofloxacin; 12% produced ESBLs. Chicken-derived strains were associated with quinolone and fluoroquinolone resistance and presence of ESBLs, while human strains were associated with susceptibility. Group B2 E. coli strains were associated with human origin, susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and presence of PAIs, whereas groups A, B1 and D showed a low virulence profile and a high level of antimicrobial resistance. In both human and animal wastewater, E. coli A, B1 and D were prevalent, and strains from both origins showed a similar virulence profile in each phylogroup. These findings led us to hypothesize that abusive antibiotic use in food animal production may promote the development of resistance among these intestinal E. coli phylogroups, which could later be transmitted to humans through the food supply. The low prevalence of E. coli group B2 in the animal gut may explain, at least in part, the absence of emergence of resistant B2 isolates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat in veterinary medicine and human healthcare. Resistance genes can spread from animals, through the food-chain, and back to humans. Sewage sludge may act as the link back from humans to animals. The main aims of this study were to investigate the occurrence of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) in treated sewage sludge, in a Swedish waste water treatment plant (WWTP), and to compare VRE isolates from sewage sludge with isolates from humans and chickens. METHODS: During a four month long study, sewage sludge was collected weekly and cultured for VRE. The VRE isolates from sewage sludge were analysed and compared to each other and to human and chicken VRE isolates by biochemical typing (PhenePlate), PFGE and antibiograms. RESULTS: Biochemical typing (PhenePlate-FS) and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed prevalence of specific VRE strains in sewage sludge for up to 16 weeks. No connection was found between the VRE strains isolated from sludge, chickens and humans, indicating that human VRE did not originate from Swedish chicken. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated widespread occurrence of VRE in sewage sludge in the studied WWTP. This implies a risk of antimicrobial resistance being spread to new farms and to the society via the environment if the sewage sludge is used on arable land.},

abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) in untreated hospital wastewaters (UHWW), their transmission into the receiving sewage treatment plant (STP) and survival through the STP treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: Over eight consecutive weeks of sampling, we isolated 224 Staph. aureus strains from UHWW-1, UHWW-2 and its receiving STP inlet (SI) and post-treatment outlet (SO). These strains were typed using the PhP typing method and RAPD-PCR and tested for their antibiotic resistance patterns. Resistance to cefoxitin and the presence of mecA gene identified MRSA isolates. In all, 11 common (C) and 156 single (S) PhP-RAPD types were found among isolates, with two multidrug resistant (MDR) C-types found in H2, SI and SO. These C-type strains also showed resistance to cefoxitin and vancomycin. The mean number of antibiotics to which the strains from UHWW were resistant (5.14 +/- 2) was significantly higher than the STP isolates (2.9 +/- 1.9) (P < 0.0001). Among the 131 (68%) MRSA strains, 24 were also vancomycin resistant. MDR strains (including MRSA) were more prevalent in hospital wastewaters than in the STP. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of the survival of MRSA strains in UHWWs and their transit to the STP and then through to the final treated effluent and chlorination stage. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This preliminary study identifies the need to further investigate the load of MRSA in hospitals' wastewaters and possible their survival in STPs. From a public health point of view, this potential route of hospital MRSA dissemination is of great importance.},

From April 2017, China will implement the withdrawal of colistin as a growth promoter, removing over 8,000 tonnes per year from the Chinese farming sector(2). To understand the impact of banning colistin and the epidemiology of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli (using blaNDM and mcr-1 as marker genes), we sampled poultry, dogs, sewage, wild birds and flies. Here, we show that mcr-1, but not blaNDM, is prevalent in hatcheries, but blaNDM quickly contaminates flocks through dogs, flies and wild birds. We also screened samples directly for resistance genes to understand the true breadth and depth of the environmental and animal resistome. Direct sample testing for blaNDM and mcr-1 in hatcheries, commercial farms, a slaughterhouse and supermarkets revealed considerably higher levels of positive samples than the blaNDM- and mcr-1-positive E. coli, indicating a substantial segment of unseen resistome-a phenomenon we have termed the 'phantom resistome'. Whole-genome sequencing identified common blaNDM-positive E. coli shared among farms, flies, dogs and farmers, providing direct evidence of carbapenem-resistant E. coli transmission and environmental contamination.},

Wastewater is a potential source for dissemination of ARB and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. The present study was conducted to determine the abundance of tetracycline resistant bacteria (TCr) and gene (tetW) in hospital and municipal wastewaters. The influence of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) on the fate of TCr bacteria and tet(W) gene was also investigated. A total of 66 samples from raw and final effluent of hospital and domestic WWTPs were analyzed. TCr bacteria as a major part of the heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria were found in the raw wastewater and final effluent samples in a concentration ranged from 1.28×108-5.19×106 to 4.60×106-ND (not detected) CFU/100ml, respectively. Tet(W) gene concentration in the raw wastewaters were found to be in the range of 3.87×107-6.23×1013 copies/100ml and WWTPs did not contribute in effective reduction of tet(w) gene. No significant correlation was found between the levels of tet(W) gene and TCr bacteria in either raw wastewater or final effluent. The results of this study showed that TCr bacteria and tet(W) gene were present in relatively high levels in both municipal and hospital wastewaters. The results also indicated that conventional wastewater treatment plants didn't contribute in effective reduction of tet(w) gene and wastewater effluents are a potential source for dissemination of tet(w) gene into the natural environment. {\textcopyright} by PSP.},

Here, we characterized carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in wastewater by whole-genome analysis. Wastewater samples (n = 40) were collected from municipal wastewater treatment plants and hospital wastewater in Japan and Taiwan. Samples were screened for CPE using selective media, and the obtained isolates were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq. The isolates (n 45) included the following microorganisms: Klebsiella quasipneumoniae (n = 12), Escherichia coli (n = 10), Enterobacter cloacae complex (n = 10), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 8), Klebsiella variicola (n = 2), Raoultella ornithinolytica (n = 1), Citrobacter freundii (n = 1), and Citrobacter amalonaticus (n = 1). Among the 45 isolates, 38 harbored at least one carbapenemase-encoding gene. Of these, the blaGES (blaGES-5, blaGES-6, and blaGES-24) genes were found in 29 isolates. The genes were situated in novel class 1 integrons, but the integron structures were different between the Japanese (In1439 with blaGES-24 and In1440 with blaGES-5) and Taiwanese (In1441 with blaGES-5 and In1442 with blaGES-6) isolates. Other carbapenemase-encoding genes (blaVIM-1, blaNDM-5, blaIMP-8, blaIMP-19, and blaKPC-2) were found in one to three isolates. Notably, class 1 integrons previously reported among clinical isolates obtained in the same regions as the present study, namely, In477 with blaIMP-19 and In73 with blaIMP-8, were found among the Japanese and Taiwanese isolates, respectively. The results indicate that CPE with various carbapenemase-encoding genes in different genetic contexts were present in biologically treated wastewater, highlighting the need to monitor for antibiotic resistance in wastewater.},

abstract = {Wastewaters serve as important hot spots for antimicrobial resistance and monitoring  can be used to analyse the abundance and diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes at the level of large bacterial and human populations. In this study, whole genome sequencing of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and metagenomic analysis of whole-community DNA were used to characterize the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in hospital, municipal and river waters in the city of Brno (Czech Republic). Cefotaxime-resistant E. coli were mainly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers (95.6%, n = 158), of which the majority carried bla(CTX-M) (98.7%; n = 151) and were detected in all water samples except the outflow from hospital wastewater treatment plant. A wide phylogenetic diversity was observed among the sequenced E. coli (n = 78) based on the detection of 40 sequence types and single nucleotide polymorphisms (average number 34,666 ± 15,710) between strains. The metagenomic analysis revealed a high occurrence of bacterial genera with potentially pathogenic members, including Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Aeromonas, Enterobacter and Arcobacter (relative abundance >50%) in untreated hospital and municipal wastewaters and predominance of environmental bacteria in treated and river waters. Genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, quinolones and macrolides were frequently detected, however bla(CTX-M) was not found in this dataset which may be affected by insufficient sequencing depth of the samples. The study pointed out municipal treated wastewater as a possible source of multi-drug resistant E. coli and antimicrobial resistance genes for surface waters. Moreover, the combination of two different approaches provided a more holistic view on antimicrobial resistance in water environments. The culture-based approach facilitated insight into the dynamics of ESBL-producing E. coli and the metagenomics shows abundance and diversity of bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes vary across water sites.},
